94,626,4.0,"Highly recommend the Wynn Tower Suites!  They arranged our meet-&-greet & round-trip airport transportation.  Upon arrival, the very kind & welcoming staff were waiting to greet us at the Wynn Tower Suites private entrance.   They offered refreshing drinks while we checked-in, the Tower Suites feature a private elevator, the rooms are very nice & quiet, & we enjoyed dining at Tableau & S&W.

Although there was a mix-up regarding my spa reservations, the staff went above-& beyond to remedy the problem.  

From arrival until we left for the airport, the service at the Wynn Tower Suites was wonderful!  Overall, a nice stay at the Wynn Las Vegas!

49,641,4.0,"I have stayed here twice now - once for pleasure and once for business - and was pleased with my experience both times.
The rooms are GORGEOUS. I recently had the opportunity to stay in the Corner Suite, and it exceeded my expectations. The room featured an unparalleled strip view of the Bellagio fountains, a full kitchen with dining table/stove/dishwasher, a washer/dryer, a huge living room, an incredibly comfortable bed, a large soaking tub, and a really nice vanity area.
I will say that if you are here for pleasure, navigating around the strip can be a little tricky due to an odd location and unmarked pedestrian entrances. And reception at the front desk is hit or miss. My last check-in agent was pretty rude when I asked for a late check-out, and essentially told me that nobody at the hotel could help me. Other than that, I really like this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",2014-01-22 19:48:09

1281,314,5.0,"My concerns, or things that bothered me when I went in to see Charles, were none smooth skin under my eyes, very poor transition from the eyes to my midcheeks, lines around my mouth and also saggy skin along my jaw line.  What I saw on myself were indentations here and there along my upper cheek and the transition to my mid cheek wasn't smooth and continuous. There was a hollowness in my cheeks which all together made me look tired and oldER!  Also I had lines around my mouth and lines between my eyes. 

I swear I looked at least 10 years younger upon leaving his office. We talked about the options and decided on theses.  Charles used some threading, injections and botox to achieve the results. This was all done in one visit within an hour!  He has so much experience with and expertise in the different products that he became an artist while sculpturing my face. 

I am 71 yrs old. For the last 20 years, I have had many many different injections and facials! You might call me a facial junkie! So I am no newbie to cosmetic procedures. I couldn't be more satisfied. I would never go to anyone other than Charles. This is what he does everyday, and he is good at it!!",2018-06-28 00:24:28
1032,463,1.0,"Hotel lobby is dark, service is ok, although newly renovated, room not well designed. Plumbing noise off and on during the night. TV is not aligned to the bed for viewing. Walls are very thin, easily able to discern a conversation from the other room. Hotel has no rule/request from patrons to have TV volume lowered at certain times of the night as the vicinity around the hotel has blaring music until 1am. Hotel issues a pair of earplugs in your assigned room upon check in. ( a hint of the extreme noise for the  length of your stay) I would advice you to look at other hotels if you must stay downtown, otherwise the hotels along the strip would be quieter. Hotel is located very far from the airport and aside from the ""Fremont experience"" not a lot is happening downtown.",2017-03-27 16:16:17

468,471,5.0,"This place is absolutely amazing. We ordered for the first time a few days ago and was so happy with our choice. Living in the Mountains Edge area, there are not a lot of great solutions for quick food so I was pleased to find a new place that had great food that was quick and definitely worth the money. I ordered grilled chicken and rice and the portions were so nice I was able to have left overs. Will definitely be going here again :)",2016-03-15 05:21:18

506,302,1.0,"Let me start by saying the buffet, initially, had a much better selection of seafood but it appears they have decided profit was more important than remaining true to their mission. The lunch buffet has turned into a standard Chinese buffet. They no longer offer sashimi, the sushi rice is barely covered with narrow, thin pieces of fish and most of their seafood dishes are typical of other buffets. What a huge disappointment!

They failed to refill the tempura station, even though there was only 3 pieces of bell pepper in the tray, and the sushi chef was so focused on slicing razor thin pieces of fish, he could barely keep up with restocking the platters. I won't be going back to Jogoya and wouldn't recommend them for lunch, unless you want typical, greasy Chinese food. It's unfortunate they have decided to settle for less than mediocre offerings. I'm not sure if Pacific Seafood Buffet has followed a similar path, but I'm not willing to find out.",2016-03-12 17:02:52

I ordered the bacon, cheese and egg sandwich and it was great. But honestly, it's a bacon, cheese and egg sandwich so it's hard to make it spectacular and it's also hard to mess up. So, pretty solid food but honestly not worth the wait for me (but maybe the other dishes are amazing? Who knows)",2018-06-09 00:36:53
1420,389,2.0,For all the hype this place gets I was really disappointed. The ambiance and atmosphere is definitely cute. There are a bunch of trees and picnic tables to eat at outside. The inside is cute as well. However we came in on Sunday a little after 11  And the inside was filthy. They weren't crowded as there was plenty of seating. We found ONE table that looked clean. There was food all over the carpet and all of the tables were just nasty. This is definitely a hotspot usually drawing big crowds so you would think that management would staff adequately. It was just gross. The food was good nothing spectacular I ordered the pesto pecan chicken burger. It wasn't pesto....it was mayonnaise based. The chicken was mediocre at best. My boyfriend  got the farm chicken sandwich and he said it was good but nothing memorable. I got the garlic fries for my side and those were absolutely amazing with tons of garlic and he ordered fried zucchini which was soggy and nasty.   Needless to say this place failed to live up to all the hype I've heard about it. We definitely won't be returning.,2016-08-28 22:45:47

1143,373,5.0,"BG is the best stylist! I love my new hairdo. 

With summer around the corner, I wanted to cut my hair short... as in real short. I walked right in on a Saturday afternoon and was scheduled for an appt. later that evening. The lady at the front desk told me she would call if an opening came up. Sure enough, within the next 30 mins I received a call and was now ready to try a hairstyle that was new and sassy without being loud.  I wanted a pixie, but wasn't really sure and BG helped me by patiently  walking me through the various choices. We finally decided on one. Not once, during my time there did I feel like I needed to read a magazine. BG made me feel extremely comfortable and surprisingly enough I felt like I could trust her with my hair (remember, this was my 1st time ever here). BG hurt the inside of her palm a few days back and was extremely cautious with how she handled my hair (she even changed her band-aid, just so I felt clean and comfortable). I strongly suggest going here for the following reasons:
- Their staff is extremely friendly, yet professional.
- Trust me, their team KNOWS what they are doing.
- They are economically priced.

Kudos BG and the team, I will be coming back. Thank you guys, the compliments just won't stop! :D",2013-03-18 23:43:15

I definitely recommend getting here as early as you can for breakfast, otherwise there is going to be a long wait.  But you know what, if there is a wait, I suggest you wait anyways the food it good! 

Ordered a BLT Mary and Corned Beef Hash, tasty!!  The bloody MAry was cute, they dressed it up and put the ""sandwich fixings"" on the side just like you could make a liquid sandwich.

Carlito's definitely rewards it's return customers.If you give them your phone number when you order, they will track your purchaes, and give you $5 for every $50 you spend.

When visiting family across the country for various holidays, we are always expected to bring the desserts from Oakmont! Their cookies, their sandwiches, their cakes, their donuts, their pies... All of it is divine. A few of my personal favorites are the almond cupcakes (simply perfection), their cream filled punckis (sp? But it's all about the icing...) and their mini fruit tart (light and refreshing). Their pricing is hands down, without a doubt, the best in Pittsburgh and the surrounding area. 95% of the time, their staff has a kind word and a smile on their face, regardless of the gigantic lines of customers they face.

593,80,5.0,"In recent years La Creperie at The Paris Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas has become one of my Las Vegas eating staples. I can not complete a trip to Vegas without a delicious crepe (sometimes two).

My last trip to Las Vegas, I had a delicious ""Seafood Crepe"" featuring scallops and shrimp smothered in a sauce that I still think of to this day.

Later in my trip i stopped in for dessert and had my usual ""The Nutella"", Peanut butter & Banana's smothered in chocolate syrup and whipped cream. This has got to be the greatest dessert on earth...

Location wise it's easy to miss La Creperie. As you walk through the Paris ""food court"" (more of a hallway) it is stuffed between two large restaurants. There is VERY limited seating and sometimes you have to battle it out for a table but people seem to come and go fast enough that you shouldn't have a problem.

Price-wise it's extremely reasonable when you consider the quality and quantity you are getting. Let me speak from experience. I had crepes in Paris, France and they weren't as good as the one's I've had at Paris, Las Vegas. These are filling, tasty and leave such a lasting impression that I guarantee you will be back for more every time you visit Vegas!",2011-01-09 07:46:03

1729,587,1.0,"I'm writing this as a final update to my Tempe Honda experience and the bottom line for both Tempe Honda and American Honda is the neither company has integrity nor keeps their promises. No matter what they say to you, their actions speak louder than any promise they make. Based upon my experience with them over the last year it is very evident that both Tempe Honda and American Honda are nice to you when they can make money off of you but after they have your money their attitudes change and they could care less about you or any concerns you have. It's worth noting that upon first contact about our airbag recall Tempe Honda did everything their could to distance themselves from this problem stating that they are just a small dealership and that they were doing all that American Honda had instructed to do, when (per American Honda) it was up to each dealership to decide how they would help their customers out. Unfortunately for me I chose to go to the wrong dealership and come to find out I chose the wrong car manufacturer.

1787,783,1.0,"I purchased a Groupon for this salon so I could give it a try, I'm looking for a good place on the west side to have my hair done.  I was really excited after looking at the website, it looked like a really nice place.  So, I made my appointment and gave it a try.  I wear my hair in a chin length bob with little bit of layering in the back, a cut that is pretty common and most stylists can do a pretty decent job on the cut.  Meshell seemed baffled, she didn't undercut the bottom, the sides were uneven and the layers were really chunky.  After struggling with my hair for a week I called and tried to have my hair fixed.  I was told Meshell is one of their best stylists, that she has never had a complaint, and that this salon does not undercut bobs.  Huh?  Jerrie B seems to be happy with lesser service because she bought her groupon at a discount, but I didn't purchase the groupon to be treated like a cut rate customer, I purchased it so I could give a new salon a chance.  I had the cut redone at a reputable salon and once again have my sleek bob that takes 5 minutes to style, not the 20 minutes it took to style the mess that Meshell made of my hair.  The only bright spot is that the rose studio did refund the unused portion of my groupon.",2010-10-09 18:14:12

204,524,4.0,"I went here with my cousin after she picked me up from the airport. She recommended it to me, as it is the original BabyStacks Cafe in Las Vegas.

I ordered their Banana Cream Pie pancakes and the Hawaiian-like combo order, which I don't remember the name of, that consisted of Spam, eggs cooked to order (I got my usual scrambled), white garlic rice and furikake (rice seasoning of Japan). The breakfast definitely reminded me of what I typically eat for breakfast, as I really love Spam! Spam was good, although I should have asked to have them cooked longer to brown them - my Spam was just cooked and hot (which isn't particularly bad). The rice could have been made better as it was more moist than I usually have white rice. The pancakes were really good, but the bananas weren't as fresh - soggy, brown was how they were presented to me. I think that the pancakes were definitely sweet enough to go with the banana cream pie part and didn't require any syrup of any kind.

I also tried my cousin's red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese syrup. It was VERY red in color (I don't think they should put that much color in there), but it turned out to taste really well and not have an artificial taste. Usually with a bright color, I associate that with artificial taste, but this was not the case for the pancakes.

Overall, I would definitely come back here again, so I can try all the other flavors of pancakes they have! The price per person was definitely matching the quality and portion of food! I recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas, or any locals!",2016-04-01 02:52:15

Finally when the gunsmith came out to the contour after the introducing my self his 1st statment is, ""you got my money"". He was an a-hole. Treated me like I'm not fit to breath the same air as him. Next time I will drive the distance to go to anouther place that's further bu I've been treated better.",2012-12-14 02:39:40

1791,518,5.0,"My wife just said.... ""That's how you treat people.""

I agree. This was our first venture to Local Bistro (LB) and we'll be back.

Great atmosphere; impeccable service from Matt and his band of teammates, to the manager who made sure we were comfortable; outstanding food.

Our 4yo had Mac and cheese + fresh berries. Extra good. My wife, mother-in-law, and I had the dip trio (the pesto made with spinach and the pequillo were delicious along with warm crispy flatbread)  to start.

Matt (our server) helped us make appropriate wine choices and never once pretended to know it all. He went for help when he didn't know everything about a wine and let us taste some wines before picking a favorite).

The wife's fish was excellent, the mil's pasta was homemade and delicious, and my pizza was warm. 

It took a bit before our food arrived.... Turns out that the fish was not cooked right so they let us know that they were remaking all of our meals to ensure freshness. We were fine with that. NOTE TO OTHER RESTAURANTS: acknowledge when something goes sideways and be honest about how you'll make up for it. Extra points.

To round out the meal they brought us 2 desserts for being first time guests and as an apology for the delay.

It is always a good feeling to have 6-star service at a 3-star price. We will be going back!",2014-06-22 03:00:47

I stayed in the paradise towers and I couldn't see anything even with the lamps on. It's way too dark and the mirrors are even dark! There's also a lot of construction going on rt now so it's annoying. Detouring the whole hotel just to get outside. The hotel as a whole is nice, clean, and could barely smell smoke.

When my boyfriend and I  sat down it took our server 15 mins just to greet us(meanwhile we were sitting right in front of the kitchen and could see that she was just taking her sweet time) then took another 15 mins just to get salad and breadsticks on our table. Our server never came and checked on us to see how we were doing once we got our food (our food wasn't very good) or if we needed anything! I had to be the one to flag her down and get something. I also heard her talking to her manager and she only had 2 tables!!! Us and the table next to us and basically ignored us the whole time.

When hitting the weights, I immediately noticed a thick coating of dusk on the cable weights and handles felt grimy when trying to get my work out in.  The gym's weight section was not organized very well... a lot of the attachments for the cable's were missing and I even noticed add-on weights were broken and just the rubber coating was keeping them together.

We each had a half dozen wings which were well cooked, nice & crispy, but drowning a bit in sauce even though we asked that they not be. The homemade chips were crisp and delicious.

It is kind of a low light atmosphere, even though we were there in the middle of the afternoon on a very sunny day. All in all, an ok experience.",2015-05-18 18:05:58

I love that they have a reg happy hour and a late night happy hour! The chicken tenders are so plump and juicy. I would have never thought to try something called bison meatloaf but holy moley it was so delish (minus the spinach sorry I can't get with the spinach on anything). The spicy thai salad had a pleasant little kick of spice but not crazy crazy spicy  (I appreciate that). The chicken ploblano with tamale cakes was also very yummy. I had a bluberry something martini- that was yum. The white peach sangria- super refreshing and delish. The irish mule was also a pleasantly tasty cocktail. I will say there was one thing I didn't care for that was the turkey meatballs with seeds and such inside (thats probably for a healthier person). EVERYTHING else was soo fricken super deliciously scrumptious I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK. Do yourself a favor and come here the food is great!,2016-10-14 06:49:00

Last time we went there, and it was the last time ever, it took our waitress 25 minutes to pick the check up off the table and return it. It became a running joke at our table of how long it would take her. To be fair, I can understand this type of wait when it's busy, but we noticed that the waitress only had 3 tables at the time.

Bellagio the fountain is nearer 5 stars than the hotel, probably because a Yelp Elite member gave it one star because they're blaming getting sick in Vegas on a strange allergy they have to teflon on the stove tops in the rooms.

So, a mere ten minute fountain show with music ranging from classical to showbiz Leonard Bernstein, this is for sure a must-see in Vegas. It's one of the many throw-ins offered to everyone on the strip, and you've never quite seen anything like it. Vegas seems to have an obsession with wasting water, but they do it in such an aesthetically pleasing way that you just have to say ""Sin City's really got it all"".

Actually, it's a good place to hang out and gaze up at the night sky at the Cosmopolitan, Paris, Aria and other luminescent eye candy scraping the man-lit heavens around you. Extra bonus vibes if you're rolling or getting folkloric.

If nothing else, light up a cig and see if you're handheld lasts the whole ten minutes. Nice way to gauge whether you should change brands, yea?",2011-04-22 06:44:54
1680,455,1.0,"Stopped by for lunch today at Jim's.  About half the tables were taken, so busy but not packed.  We ordered a couple burgers and drinks.  We took out table and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  There was a table of 6 next to us and I was amazed how their order was delivered one burger at a time, about 5 minutes apart.  And we waited.  It took 33 minutes to get 2 regular burgers and 2 drinks. Not even offered our drinks while we waited, no updates on the status of our order.  There were 7 people working around the grill... it was crazy.  I could have gotten a better burger at Red Robin or other restaurants in half the time.  Really too bad, we could use a good cafe on the west side.  

Pros:  Good location
            Staff was reasonably friendly
            Prices were not out of line
            Sizable menu (in fact, probably too large or ambitious)

Cons: Amazingly disorganized kitchen
            No Coke or Dr. Pepper. I was amazed now many people in line  
            asked for both, but got neither.

1441,533,3.0,"I was underwhelmed with Mesa Grill.  Being it was the restaurant of a famous chef, I was expecting more.  

First of all, don't come here if you're hungry.  The portions are small and I left feeling like I was taken.  Here's why....
The service was okay, the atmosphere was okay - nothing spectacular for Las Vegas.  We had the goat cheese fundido for an appetizer and it was good.  It had a very nice meld of flavors that complimented each other.  I ordered the shrimp tacos.  It was literally two tacos, two skewers of three shrimp each, cabbage, and two home made tortillas.  It came with a side of diced avocado, verde salsa and something else that I didn't try.  The shrimp were medium size - so like I said, if you're hungry try another place. 
My friend had the Mesa Burger.  This was pretty darn good.

The star of the show was the French fries.  They had some type of spice on them that was delicious and crunchy. 

The reason I gave this place only 3 stars is because I'm in Las Vegas!  Like everything else, the food should be spectacular and over the top.  I'm sorry Bobby, I was not overly impressed.",2018-07-19 04:41:27

1st sign of poor management:

Hostess said ""1.5-2 hour wait"" so we went to bar to have a drink to kill time. Actually seated in 25 mins...

2nd sign of poor management:

Bar and restaurant have different menus,
Which means you can't transfer from bar to table

3rd sign of poor management:

Total communication confusion between hostess and waiting staff. Waited 8 mins from notification that table was ready to actually being seated.

4th sign of poor management:

We paid two bills (1 at bar and 1 at restaurant) 

Manager told us we would receive a free round of drinks for the inconvenience. We never received the ""free"" round of drinks the manager stated he would give us for the poor experience.

5th sign of poor management:
Accused the table of stealing a place setting that was located in the bar doggy bag the restaurant placed there...

6th sign of poor management:
Manager had to call police to fix his problem... what??

593,80,5.0,"In recent years La Creperie at The Paris Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas has become one of my Las Vegas eating staples. I can not complete a trip to Vegas without a delicious crepe (sometimes two).

My last trip to Las Vegas, I had a delicious ""Seafood Crepe"" featuring scallops and shrimp smothered in a sauce that I still think of to this day.

Later in my trip i stopped in for dessert and had my usual ""The Nutella"", Peanut butter & Banana's smothered in chocolate syrup and whipped cream. This has got to be the greatest dessert on earth...

Location wise it's easy to miss La Creperie. As you walk through the Paris ""food court"" (more of a hallway) it is stuffed between two large restaurants. There is VERY limited seating and sometimes you have to battle it out for a table but people seem to come and go fast enough that you shouldn't have a problem.

Price-wise it's extremely reasonable when you consider the quality and quantity you are getting. Let me speak from experience. I had crepes in Paris, France and they weren't as good as the one's I've had at Paris, Las Vegas.

We were seated promptly as we arrived on time for our reservation.  I was surprised the restaurant was not packed given Spring Training, and convention were in town.  
The wine list seems paired down since our last visit as there weren't the same number of selections for whites and reds as I remember from the list.  We both ordered various glasses of white wines for first course and entrée.
What I was most happy with is Roy's Trio and Classic Four were cooked perfectly.  Too many items on our last visit seemed to be pre-cooked waiting for warming up as items were ordered.
Roy's Maui has always rated 5 stars because of better service, better wine list and overall better food execution.  We were there just this past December and no, I don't add the location as a boost for that Roy's.

872,699,5.0,"The service department at Ford Country is second to none. After our van's service engine light came on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, we were out of commission for the rest of the weekend including the holiday Monday. I called first thing Tuesday morning to schedule an appointment and spoke with Anna in reservations. You could hear how nice & helpful she was in her voice right over the phone. It was so refreshing to hear her kindness & willingness to help. 

I explained the situation with the van and how we had been stuck at home since Saturday and if there was anything she could do to help me get the van in ASAP, I would appreciate it. She was able to schedule me an appointment for the very next day which is usually very difficult to do considering how busy dealerships are, especially after a holiday weekend (we always use the dealership for vehicle issues because our van is leased). 

Upon drop off the next day, I was greeted with a smile by Justin Allen, fleet manager. He was amazing! Not only was he polite, courteous, and knowledgeable but helpful in assuring me that some other services my van was due for would be taken care of as well, therefore avoiding me having to make another appointment in a few weeks. He even reminded me to take my garage door opener with me! He advised me he would call or text me by noon that day updating me with vehicle repair info. 

After being shuttled home for free (another awesome service provided by the dealership), Justin reached out to me not even 2 hours later to let me know the issue was being fixed, told me what the problem was & advised it was indeed completely covered by the warranty.  What really stuck out with me was the fact that they didn't ""find"" anything else wrong with the van that wasn't ""covered"" under the warranty or anything like that. My only out of pocket cost was the oil change I already knew I was paying for, at exactly the price Justin told me it would be.

I don't understand how people say the bouncers are rude, I have NEVER had an issue getting into this club.  

The main floor and the outside area is the best.  There are two other rooms, the library and the boombox room, which are cool if you like hip hop or want something other than EDM.  

The EDM scene here is the best that you can get in the US, even better than Hollywood (and I'm from LA).  THe main floor is cool because you really can get super close to famous internationally renowned djs. You may even get to meet them ;).  It's the exact same with the Day Club, you get as close as 5 feet from the djs.  The pool party is classy, but fun and with good music, it really does not get any better.

Food wasn't so terrible that RWB needs to earn just 1 star but the menu was obviously designed towards people who favor size and quantity over quality and authenticity. Portions are humongous!! If that's what you're looking for then this is your restaurant, but if you're wanting something that isn't smothered in cheese to hide dull Italian food then look elsewhere. Unfortunately I haven't found anything that's decent which isn't in Scottsdale or Phx. Bummer. The search continues...",2017-10-14 02:10:58
15,154,5.0,"The food is excellent, and we had fantastic service here. My only issue is  I would have preferred happy hour but didn't realize it was just in the bar, and the host didn't mention that.

I was interested in a lot of the menu options, but we were waiting for a concert, so I didn't want to eat a lot of heavy food. I ordered a can of some kind of beer that I wish I remembered because it was delicious. This is the type of restaurant where they always bring you a chilled glass and pour most of it out for you. Not necessary, but it was nice.

We were in a quiet corner in the back but noticed everyone seemed to be eating the pretzels as a appetizer, which we ordered. We received a fairly large basket of pretzels plus a fondue pot of cheese with a small tealight under it to keep it warm. What a cute idea! The cheese stayed warm without overcooking while in the pot. The pretzels were delicious, just the right amount of flaky salt.

I ordered their caesar salad, and it was delicious. It came with a few vegetables I didn't expect, which I really enjoyed. I don't care for brussel sprouts but didn't even notice them. The only issue was the dill in the salad. Instead of chopping it, it had had a lot of dill sprigs in it, which wasn't great to eat. I just moved them to the side and picked off little bits here and there.

Overall, a bit pricy, but you'll enjoy the food, service, and atmosphere.",2017-12-31 18:42:55

959,188,3.0,"THEhotel, the sister hotel to Mandalay Bay, was slightly disappointing.  Although I really liked the modern decor and large rooms, there were a few downsides that were quite unpleasant.  First of all, the whole hotel reeked of sulfur, from the lobby to the hallways.  I'm not sure what the cause of that smell was but it was pretty disgusting.  Luckily the smell wasn't in our room!  The rooms are spacious but the beds are not very comfortable.  Even though it was nice that the hotel didn't have a casino, thus no smoke, it would have been convenient to have its own pool.  If you want to go to the pool, its a 10-15 minute walk from the bottom of the elevators.  Overall, it's not the best hotel, and I probably won't be returning.",2013-05-08 00:34:30

307,537,3.0,"I got this hotel for a great deal on priceline (less than 115 per night)

This was my first trip to Vegas, so not really familiar with much of the hotels but I had several friends staying in other places. At first I thought maybe our room was smaller than some of the other hotels like Paris and the Monte Carlo, etc but after visiting our friends rooms I realized ours was the same size.

If you are picky about ""ritzy"" rooms, or looking to spend a lot of time in your hotel and want everything literally at your fingertips, this isn't the place to go. The casino and pool are small and there's nothing terribly ""Vegas"" about this hotel. No shops, only one restaurant, one bar... it's very small scale. 

For us, it was great. We just hung out at other hotels to get the kitschy Vegas experience but still had a comfortable nice room to come back to that was half the price of other hotels and within walking distance of lots of Vegas hotspots. I'd say if you are looking for an affordable nice room and willing to go out of your hotel to experience Vegas this is a great choice. 

The staff was very helpful, valet was quick, check-in was MUCH faster than it was for my other friends staying in other hotels, and because there's not 3000 rooms in this place its easy to get to your room without having to wait for an elevator or navigate a maze.",2008-08-18 21:37:58

They were small and very average.  Providing a tasty dipping sauce with the wings doesn't compensate for small blah wings you could find anywhere.  We went back again 2 days later and tried the Trash Can Nachos.  Ours looked nowhere like the picture and was overloaded with a nasty tasting cheese that overpowered the entire dish.  I never thought I'd use the words 'too much cheese', but this was just nasty.  $20 Nachos should at least taste great. I'll upload a picture of them after posting this review.

Onto the good.....

We had Spicy Bloody Mary's on both visits.  Worth the $15 price each and huge. It's a little inconsistent on toppings, but nonetheless really good.

Service was a little slow on my first visit, but after seeing the Bloody Mary, I understood why It took a little longer, and I was fine with that.

The take.......

Bring those Fire Ball wings back.  Why would you even take something so good off the menu, only to replace them with something people can get anywhere?

Either revisit the Trashcan Nachos recipe, or revisit the staff that are making it.  Who would ever expect Nachos to be bad?  How do you screw that up?  That cheese is pungent nasty.",2018-06-19 15:58:52

We, myself and two family members came in on a Sunday night. First red flag the place was completely empty at 7:00pm. The restaurant was recommended by a close friend so we decided to give it a fair chance.

Roti Telur: 8/10- tasty and authentic (my favourite of the night)
Young chow fried rice: 6/10- nothing special, bland
Singapore fried mee hoon- 7/10- flavourful, but not many shrimp (2 in total)
Lamb Rendang; 5/10- taste of curry not bad, quality of meat was terrible
Sizzling chicken: 7/10: tasty but small portions of meat

For desert we chose the fried banana Grenade, which was absolutely terrible. The bananas were not ripe and the oil in which they were fried had a disgusting aftertaste, indicating it was old oil. We were very unimpressed with this dish.

We get there late and find that they have given up our room. Ok so we're off to a poor start, the front desk tries to ask us to pay for an upgrade to another room, but hello this is not our fault, so with that reasoning we get bumped up. 

We walk in and it is an astonishing view. Our room on the 50th floor faces the golf course and the beautiful waterfall behind it. The room is stunning with floor to ceiling windows and decorative mirrors. The shades are drawn by buttons in the middle console next to the beds. Not only are there 2 queen beds, there are two sinks and a vanity. There's a LCD in the bathroom, plasma in the main room and the alarm clock is an iHome iPod player that can charge our iPhones with. The room is amazing.

Downstairs there are several late dining facilities and stores that open till midnight and serve drinks like mimosas and sparkling wine while you peruse the products. I get giddy just thinking about how nice it was. 

The staff and promoters here were also very helpful. Being guests there we had instant access to the club, which opens up onto their outdoor waterfall. While the music was subpar which I find with many Vegas clubs the view was fabulous and the drinks were good.

I had an amazing time staying here. It doesn't matter that it's at the end of the strip, it's just one of the nicest places to stay and besides we took cabs everywhere we went so who cares about walking around?",2009-05-20 06:31:52

But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.  

You will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.  

The lofty recommendation to visit Café Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression.",2017-01-27 20:52:48
263,744,5.0,"The seating situation was terrible.  There were so many people there and I would have gladly taken the food to my room if I was actually staying there.  I was staying at a much lower budget hotel and it was 2 blocks away but getting through all those people...ick.

Now for the good part:  I went there 2x in 2 consecutive days.  The first day I bought 2 slices of pizza with a drink for about $10 and immediately regretted it.  My friend picked up an awesome looking sandwich of provolone cheese and prosciutto with the tiny french pickles.  I went back the second day and bought that while my friends went to buffets.  It was so worth the trip by myself.  I got that and had my own water.

The sandwich was roughly $9 and if you want it with chips and drink it's only $12.  In Vegas, what a deal.",2010-12-18 08:57:00

804,42,4.0,"As a vegan, I have heard great things by people who have reviewed this eatery, and by coworkers. I decided to give it a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the unchicken, sweet potato mash, collard greens and waffles. My mother, had the same thing as myself, except she had a side of macaroni and cheese. 

We ordered the Shitake mushroom ""clams"" for a starter, and these were delicious. Very filling, and a large quantity. The dip was great, and went along really well with the mushrooms. Give it a try if you ever go. 

The unchicken were crisp, and hot. They tasted almost like real chicken, and I'm sure that people who aren't vegans, would have loved the food here as well. The sweet potato mash was fluffy and warm, and was a wonderful side to the meal. The collard greens were not bitter, and had a garlic glaze of some sort, I enjoyed them. And the waffles were mind blowing, I truly did indulge. 

My mother's dish was also well made, except she and I could agree that the mac n' cheese had an acquired taste. They were very sour, and the taste of vinegar was over powering. She struggled to eat it all, and said that combining it with other foods made it taste better and dilute the sour flavor. 

The water, came in quaint water bottles, but it was room temperature, maybe even warm. If it was refrigerated, it would have been a lot more thirst-quenching. 

The service, was impeccable. The people who work there are very sweet, and inviting. They're all smiles, and they check on you, and get your order fast. Really happy with the service. 

The place is very easy to miss, it has a tiny little sign which says ""hog town vegan's"", so you must be careful when searching for it!",2014-08-25 01:54:53
1386,291,1.0,"Early December, 2017, a software update showed in my phone settings under General, software update. On 12-21-17 I went into the settings to process the update. It had a bug in it. It wouldn't take my numeric passcode I use daily on the home screen. Same day approx lunch time, I called Verizon who took my monthly payment over the phone then had me reset the passcode in settings to the same passcode. It did not work and I was now locked out of my phone. I could not dial out - only emergencies.  I couldn't call Verizon or anyone. I used my iPad and went online to Verizon and got Zack on chat. I told him I just got off the phone with Verizon who locked my phone and how could Verizon fix it. He asked me where I changed my passcode. I said the settings screen. He said he could not help me and sent me a link for passcodes to work.  
The link says to go to itunes, plug your phone in and click 'recover.'  I plugged it it into my laptop. A message came up on my laptop asking to allow to connect to my iPhone. I clicked yes or allow. It clocked then came up with an error message that it could not connect to the phone. The phone never showed a message on the locked screen to connect to the laptop. I turned the phone off and on. Nothing happened. It still would not take my passcode. 
I immediately left for the nearest verizon store on 7th Street and Bell Road. 
I told a guy there was a software update that would not take my passcode on that screen. I told him I called verizon about an hour ago who had me reset my passcode to the same one and now I'm locked out of my phone. He blamed Apple and said Verizon is not responsible for Apple. He said you need to call Apple or go to an Apple store. I said I need to cancel my account then. He said I couldn't cancel my phone in the store. Your going to have to call verizon. I said with a phone that doesn't work?  He said you can use a phone here. I called verizon and told them the same issue. They blamed Apple. I said if Apple can't fix this, I'm going to cancel my account. She put me through to Apple. The guy said the only way to reset your passcode is to go to iTunes!  I said I did that already. He said for an iphone, you need to reset it until the apple with the cord shows on the phone and press recover. I said I plugged it into the laptop, it clocked. I turned the iPhone on and off while plugged into the laptop and it still did not work. I did it several times. He said I can't see what update you had. I said yes you can. Your Apple then said goodbye. 
I could not get to an Apple store until 8pm same night 10 miles away due to previous plans. The phone started working right when I walked in. It took the thumb print and the screen showed. The guy there said it was probably updating. I walked out of the store a few steps and decided to try the software update that originally caused this mess. Sure enough it would not take the passcode and I was locked out again. I walked back in to the Apple store. I told a young woman working there the issue with the software update not taking my passcode. She said I would have to make an appointment and there is nothing available until next week!  I said no. 
Apple is the one who sent the software upgrade causing my phone to be locked out and now useless. She said their not authorized to change a passcode. I said Verizon blames Apple and Apple blames Verizon. She said I know how you feel. I said Do you? She said I could talk to Apple support on the phone. I said No.  I already did that. That's why I'm here. She said due to the holidays, we have a higher volume and I can't get you in until next week. I said I'm not the one who caused this, Apple did and between you and Verizon I still don't have a phone that works. I walked out. This is unacceptable. They should've taken me that night. They need an accountability and make up for the stress they caused me and right before the holidays. 
Biltmore Apple fixed the problem by resetting the phone the next morning. And yes, they fixed the problem with the passcode even though the young woman at Arrowhead Apple said she Apple was not authorized. Liar.",2017-12-22 19:37:35

We huddled as close as possible, wondering why it wasn't already snowing and why the water hasn't frozen yet. All of this, however, generated enough romance to heat things to a boil.

We watched two shows with appropriately themed music that was timed to a tee. The music boomed, and the water shot high in orgasmic fashion. You could feel the pressure on your face, and if the wind was strong enough, the spray also. I think the Bellagio was secretly trying to help me get get laid with all of these subconscious persuasions.

461,725,5.0,"Every time I come here I try to give myself a pep talk that I'll order something other than a Pan Roast. If I'm unlucky enough to have to wait in line, I stare at the digital menu and commit to trying the gumbo, the lobster tail, the étouffée. But once I plop down at the seat, the inevitable happens: Pan Roast it is. 

But that's because they're bomb as fuck.

It doesn't matter which one you get--Shrimp, Lobster, Crab or Combo (all 3), they're all absolutely fantastic. I usually get spice level 7 or 8, but that's because I require hot ass food. Spice it how you like, but the FLAVOR is there regardless.

Try your best not to stare at the meager countenances of the hungry, salivating customers in line as you eat who stare back at you with their arms folded, hoping you don't sit there savoring every bite for hours and just eat and get the fuck out already. Similarly, try not to walk around patrons looking them up and down with dirty looks as a ""subtle"" way to rush them.

I find that Sunday mornings I never have to wait. And I like the cook who's usually there. Any other time I go, there's a wait. Longest I've ever waited was an hour.  

I say all this to say I will give up my 1st born for a Pan Roast at my disposal. Okay, not the 1st born. But maybe my pet. Okay, my neighbor's pet. It appears to be depressed anyway.",2015-04-21 03:59:05

First, the decor of this place is amazing, it fits Giada's personality/image really well. My wife loved it! 

Next, the location is great. If getting a table for 2, request a window seat to get views of the Bellagio Fountains.

Finally: the food. We went for brunch and got the brunch tasting menu. I really enjoyed the pastries and salumi plate that came out. That was probably the highlight of the meal to me. I got the Lasagna and my wife got the Italian Chicken and Waffles. Both were solid, but nothing special. Just good. For dessert, my wife got the sherbert ice cream sandwich deal and I got the Espresso Tower deal, which was basically an ice cream cake, cut large enough for 4 people to share!

1177,526,1.0,"The week before Father's day, my husband and I were up in Mount Charleston and saw they were doing a Father's Day AYCE BBQ.  I thought this would be a great Father's day outing for my parents and my in-laws, somewhere with a great view, cooler weather, and something different from the regular packed restaurants.  

I called a few days before Sunday to check to make sure they were still doing it and what was going to be different for Father's Day vs. their regular summer Sunday AYCE BBQ since the price went from $19.99 to $39.99.   I spoke with a gentlemen and he said food wise they would have different things besides the normal hamburger, hot dog, bratwurst, etc.  It'd be more and also there would be a roasted pig. The roasted pig was one of the big factors we ended up going.  

There was no communication whatsoever from the moment we arrived at the Resort.  
1)  Normally the BBQ is outside but for Father's Day they had it indoors - there wasn't any signs telling you where to go.  
2) The AYCE is schedule weekly from 12PM-4PM but they were running late and no one could tell us what time they would be opening.  They finally opened at 12:30pm but by than a lot of people left. 
3) Upon entering the ""restaurant"" no one know what to do, there wasn't anyone to direct people regarding seating.  We ended up seating ourselves at a table but only after we tried a few chairs at different tables - all of them were mismatching and not stable, a lot of them had the seat cushion broken off the chairs.  
4) Payment - this is one of the best part of the day lol we saw people starting to get food but we weren't sure if we're suppose to pay before or after.  We went up to the bar where three bartenders were just hanging out not really doing anything and asked.  The one bartender told us we had to pay ahead of time which is normally fine but it's the condescending tone she used.  Really!?! How would anyone know that when there isn't any employee or signs to tell us.  
5) Food - The selection of food was barely passable as food.  The salad bar was small but wasn't too bad as its hard to miss up salad.  All the main items were either hard, cold, or burnt.  The selection for $40 bucks was laughable - little hard ""steaks,"" burnt chicken, and under cook ribs.  The sides were cafeteria Mac & Cheese, roasted vegs, and collard greens.  They had one action station, the ""Mash Potato Bar"" which is a pretty unique concept but everyone that walked by thought it was an Omelet station since NOTHING WAS LABELED - from the salad, main, side, and the potato bar.  

I asked the cook at the potato bar when will they be bringing out the pig today.  He said later.  My obvious reply is when is ""later"" since you guys open late and this is only here until 4pm.  He said he wasn't sure but later.  

6) Service - After we got our food, we sat down and figured we'd might as well make the most of it.  The waitress came around, pleasant enough, but that's when we found out there isnt any roasted pig as the fire department would not give the resort the permit to do a fire pit.  At this point I go to the bar (as no one employee seems to be around except for the bartenders doing nothing) and asked if this was true.  Come to find out one of the bartender was the GM (this was the same bartender that had the condescending tone).  Perfect! I told her my story about calling ahead of time and her only response said that it was never advertised and they aren't doing the pig until next month.  That's funny if its not advertised than how come your own employee, the cook for the potato bar, seems to think there is a roasted pig as well.  The whole conversation she continue to be condescending and makes me wonder who she had to throw under the bus to get her position.  

Whatever,  the GM is one person but funny enough, every employee there seems not know whats going on or how to do their job - as mentioned before communication is horrible, food doesn't get refilled unless a guest ask, etc.  Our waitress never comes back since her first visit, she would talk to the table behind us for 10 minute increments and ignore our tables and other tables around us.  Like our table, other tables had empty plates stacked sitting there, waiting for some person called a ""waitress"" to pick them up and take them into the kitchen.  

There were a few tables in the restaurant that ordered from the menu instead - every table that did that we could hear their comments that how come the food takes over 30 minutes to come out.  There were a few people when they finally got their food, it was cold.  

I've never had such bad service in a restaurant before.  The fact that every single employee didn't know how to do their job or the simple act of communicating with their customer.",2014-07-04 20:16:32

We were definitely planning on seeing it, so it was perfect! There were other discounts in the package (to an Asian restaurant and a Mexican one at Palazzo) but we didn't use those. 

The Venetian...OMG, I loved that place! The perfume scent that others complain about in their reviews, actually wasn't bad...I was worried about it, being highly allergic to strong smelling perfumes, but it was actually really nice...I even miss it now...I didn't sneeze at all from it. We arrived early, 2pm, and they checked is in no problem (3pm is checkin)...Our room was very-very nice, my hubby's jaw sort of dropped when he first saw the room (I booked the whole thing so I already saw the pictures). It was very spacious, from the bathroom to the bedroom/living room...3 TVs in the place! I subtracted a star though b/c our TV in the bathroom did not work :( I was bummed b/c being a woman I spend a LOTTA time in there :) 

The pool area on the 4th floor was very nice (there's another pool with more shade and more privacy on the 10th floor too)...I didn't check out Tao Beach, because I didnt even realize that was in a different area until later. My hubby walked by it and said it was nothing major, so I believed him. There were sufficient chairs at the pool, and the waitresses came by occasionally to see if anyone needed drinks. They could've made more money personally if they came by more frequently. Drinks were good, and the restaurant (Riva by Wolfgang Puck) has really good lunch menu (Pizza was great, and their salads too).

We ordered the Full Montague and the Italian. Decent sandwiches, kinda small for the price they charge you.  The Italian came with a variety of meats like salami, ham and mortadella. It was topped with tomatoes and a vinaigrette type dressing. The Full Montague had roast beef, turkey, cheese, tomatoes. The bread was really good, they were hot sammys, so it came toasted. The sammys weren't bad, they just weren't anything special. I think I am spoiled by what I can get at back at home.

They said that they would be able to get us a new room the next day between 11a and noon, that did not happen. I called three time to ask when was the room ready which was promised to me with a pool view and 17th floor at 11a, i had no success! They sent me a text message at 7pm saying my room was ready. When we went to inquire about the room and get the new keys.. the room was not what they said at all. So i spent the whole day trying to find a new hotel bc i was so pissed, but my husband said ''no, we paid for this place"".. So we had them comp all the resort fees :) 
Next lets talk about the room.. the room is clean, the beds are comfortable. Even the non smoking floors have cig smoke coming thru the venting system.. it sucks, and I'm pretty sure i will have lung cancer before i leave..
Ok lets talk about the restaurants... pink taco is average as are all the others. The 35 steak place looks good but i didn't eat there. My husband did order wings for room service and he said they sucked...
The drinks at the casino bars are ok... they do have a nice 2 for 1 happy hour everyday from 4 -7p. If you're not a smoker, just being on the casino floor is such a hazard to your breathing... Everyone smokes!! 
Needless to say, we only slept here!!! we chose to do nothing else in this hotel at all... This hotel is for people looking to party 24/7 and couldn't care less about service, cleanliness, or a real good experience. Someone threw up on the 10th floor at the elevators... no one has cleaned it off the wall yet!! it's been 48hrs!!!
I will never stay here again!!! This hotel isn't on the strip which mean we had to take a cab everyday to and from the strip to have a good time.

The only good thing about this hotel was the manager named Christian.. He said he was sorry about our experience with the hotel and comp'ed all the resort fees..

This was my first Cirque du Soleil experience and I'm reluctant to have another because this will be so hard to top. Be sure to get a Beatles-titled drink on your way in.",2015-12-20 23:41:11
192,552,4.0,"I know this place is new and probably should be the hottest thing in town, but after a couple stays, I'm not convinced.  Don't get me wrong, this place isn't a dump, but just left a tad to be desired.  The hotel/gaming floor/amenities are fantastic, but the rooms (for a place like that) should have been bigger, IMO.  The only thing I liked about the room is the huge view of the Wynn Golf Course; man, I love that view.  The tables were great with really friendly pit bosses and dealers which, to me, makes for a good time while gambling (besides winning big).

XS is one of the newer/popular clubs in town, which is located at Encore.  I was pretty impressed with the place and although the main club isn't too big, the gigantic pool area more than makes up for it.  That's all I'll probably say about XS since the club warrants a review of its own.

Overall, this is one of the better places to stay in Vegas.  I know I'm kinda' short-changing this place because we don't spend too much time in the rooms anyway, but at the rate you pay (when you're not comp'd), I think they should be bigger.",2009-05-28 20:51:57

We decide to order the guacamole which was bland and lacked any flavor besides a strong onion flavor (some spice, salt, and lime was needed).

Unfortunately the meal was far from redeeming.  I ordered the beef quesadilla.  The outershell was soaked in oil and unedible and it was loaded with so much cheese that it overpowered the beef so I ended up picking the quesadilla to push everything to the side except for the beef, which was cooked well but could have been seasoned better.

It had an expansive menu which was great for people who have a wide range of preferences in food, however that was unfortunately the only good thing I experienced at Border Grill.",2013-10-03 15:24:04

Atmosphere and decor is frightening, and for the kind of food you get, it's terribly over priced. 2.50$ for a TINY cup of shitty coffe?(it should be no more than a buck), the gravy that came w the ""biscuits and gravy"" tasted like it was a premade- packaged gravy mix (not home made) the home fries were overwhelmed w oregano.

I should've stayed out there so I could've had room to dance, but it was still really fun. The not so big dance floor got packed fast and closed pretty early on in the night. Fearing I wouldn't be able to return back to the main room, I ended up just staying inside. Despite the packed crowd, everyone was friendly and gave it a fun atmosphere. A&B's set was also really enjoyable and kept the energy up. At one point, they directed a snide remark towards will.i.am for his rip off of Rebound which left the crowd cheering. With its beautiful setup, Surrender is definitely one of my favorite venues in Vegas. Untz Untz Untz

We started with the Foo Foo plater (just to be able to try a bit of everything). It was pretty good actually, I'd highly recommend it! Our server (i believe her name was Nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful. She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice. I'd give this place one more try...But I most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again.",2015-01-03 22:17:56
1674,694,4.0,"My first experience here was very pleasant. The lady who served us was very kind. I ordered ""angel cream"" and ""Mt. Fuji"" and was surprised at the little details they put into the food. Wasn't the best dessert ever but it was pretty decent. I was more fascinated at how it looked rather than how it taste. They also placed my glass of water on top this LEGO looking coaster. I thought that was funny yet adorable. Waiting time for the dessert didn't take too long either for a place that was busy. A little pricey overall but that's what you get for eating artsy types of foods.  

I guess I would warn those who are very claustrophobic that this place is very small with little amount of space to walk through. Tables are very close to one another and it is a little uncomfortable getting in and out of your seat.

1646,474,1.0,"Bought a Dodge Challenger at Towbin Dodge in 2014 and was pressed beyond belief to buy an extended warranty for $2,000 by their obnoxiously pushy finance guy.  He also pressed me to buy the gap coverage and a tire / rim warranty.  
I sold this vehicle recently to Carmax (great experience by the way!).  After looking at my paperwork, the helpful person at Carmax informed me that I was entitled to pro-rated rebates on all of these items I'd purchased from Towbin Dodge.
I went back to Towbin Dodge with all of the paperwork I was given when I bought the car from them and asked their finance dept. to process these refunds.  They quickly picked thru my paperwork and said they'd process the gap and wheel warranty refund but they advised me they couldn't help me with the general warranty because I didn't have my actual policy.  I explained this was ALL the paperwork I was given when I bought the car from them.  I've never removed a single paper from the paperwork they gave me and never had any reason to look through it until now.
I asked nicely and repeatedly for them to help me.  I said, ""surely you guys must be able to get me a copy of the policy you sold me for $2,000"".  The finance guy repeatedly said, ""nope, sorry guy - can't help you.""  I said over and over, ""can't you at least give me the number for the company so I can get it myself""?  Again, he was completely unhelpful and rude and kept saying no as he walked away.  
Thinking quickly, I went into their service department and thought maybe if I trick them into thinking they can get some work out of me, then they might be willing to help me, so I walked up there and showed the guy a copy of my sales contract from 2 years ago.  I showed him the line item for $2,000 that showed I was charged $2,000 by Towbin Dodge for a warranty policy from First Automotive.  I told the guy I needed to get some warranty work done but I misplaced First Automotive's phone number and he then quickly and gladly gave it to me.
I called First Automotive and explained that I sold the car and asked what I needed to do get a refund on my warranty.  They said to email them that I was cancelling the policy along with a copy of my odometer disclosure and bill of sale to prove that I sold the car, which I did.
After about a month, I called First Automotive back to check on the status of my refund.  They were unable to find any record of me or my warranty that Towbin Dodge supposedly ordered with my $2,000.  Maybe that's why the Towbin Dodge finance guy practically ran away when I asked him to help me with a warranty refund.  Maybe they never ordered it and someone pocketed my money?
Maybe they'll be a little nicer and more forthcoming in producing my warranty for the Judge when I file suit.",2016-07-02 00:10:42

I lived in NYC for 6 years and have turned in to some what of a pizza snob, always on the hunt for a pizza spot similar to ones in NYC. I finally found it! From their menu and toppings, to the experience at pick-up and then the actual pie itself, everything was excellent and of superior quality.

When I picked up the pie the woman behind the counter asked me if I was a new customer, she then shouted to the kitchen, using my name, that I was new and everyone cheered saying ""hi/welcome Tiffany"". She then offered me an order of free garlic knots to try as a first time customer. It definitely set the tone for what then was the best pizza I have found in Arizona, and quite frankly outside of NYC.

I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat. 

When we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was ""going to be complicated or not."" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too. 

I had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service. Definitely do NOT recommend going there!!! Don't know exactly which was our original waitress but our checks said Joanne G.

The atmosphere was wonderful, modern but classy with some nice touches such as the candle on the table. (See attached picture). I also loved the disco ball antelope heads in the wall. Made for a fun environment. 

My colleague ordered an iced tea and I had an old fashioned (see picture). Overall, the drinks were good, very large beverage menu to choose from (almost too large). My old fashioned was made with a lemon twist, was missing the cherry, and had wayyyyy too much ice (the small stuff that melts quickly) A little disappointing when pouring a premium bourbon.  

As for the food,  we were impressed here. I started with the pastrami sliders (see attached) and my colleague had the fish tacos in the taro root shells. Both were very good, however, the tacos seemed small on their presentation taco rack (obviously made for much larger tacos). 

My sliders were delicious and the pickles tasted like they were made in house, delicious. 

For our entrees, I had the lamb osso bucco and it was fantastic. I would have liked to have a little more room on the plate to make eating it easier, but the seared orzo and osso bucco was amazing. I would absolutely recommend. Many places over cook this until it is overly falling apart. Here it was done very well. 

My colleague had the barramundi and said it was very good. It looked to have a nice sear on it and he said the flavor was good. It looked a little dry to me, but he said it was good. 

For dessert, we actually skipped this course because they didn't really seem to be too imaginative or creative. 

The service was great. The waiter placed out napkins, the staff were quick with refills, and they did an excellent job of describing the items when dropped. My only suggestion to management is make sure the staff know the alcohols offered or can sell the drinks better than simply dropping the iPad menu. Our server asked if we would like a cocktail and I told her I wanted an old fashioned and she asked me what kind of bourbon I wanted and she couldn't give me a recommendation. 

Overall, I will be coming back. Nice calm, relaxed environment, good food and reasonable prices for the strip. Glad I stumbled upon this place. Would be a great date spot.",2014-08-20 17:48:57

566,766,2.0,"You know this place really looks great and could be great just like The Griddle Café is within its' confines.  The machines were loose with a lot of bonuses, not always big bonuses but those are what really make these new, modern machines so much fun.  The front desk and the people there are always great.  Security is good and cool.  The room designer screwed up in a couple of places with toilet paper out of reach for short arms and a desk which has a glass top that is too big so has to be angled because of an electrical socket built into the desk itself.  Dumb, and spoils what otherwise is a very nice room with a nice, big television set.  So why two stars?  This place isn't doing enough business and they want to appeal to locals and yet some idiot has hip hop and electronic music for the most part pounding into our heads while we are trying to enjoy gambling and talking.  It's not only jolting but you can't hear machines paying off which too me is how you attract more and new players.  Doesn't make sense, especially with the type of crowd that is in the majority there and this particular night, 01/22/15, even more so with all these businessmen who were there for some kind of meetings.  I could see where a lot of people would just never come back for this reason alone.  Red Rock does the same thing and it's even dumber because they have a great majority of seniors there most of the time.  I can't speak about all of the casinos but whoever is running these should visit The Orleans where the music is just a background noise and you can still hear the machines.  If that doesn't convince you then try surveying your guests now and then.  We've stayed over for two birthdays and we won't like to make those a twice annual event because overall we really like this place, including Cleo, but if the music volume doesn't go down and they don't start playing more sensible music, oh well.  We are an older couple but we are also Rock 'n Roll, not old fuddy-duddies; it's just TOO LOUD!",2015-01-23 19:20:57

The girl behind the counter obviously just wanted me to leave, the blond kid working snapped at me when I asked a question and when I re-asked in order to clarify what he said he snapped again and said, ""I already told you?!?""  ""Is this even authentic?""  Shouting at me over his shoulder as he work on something else. 

I was shocked and just stood there put my watch away awkwardly and left with no one else saying a word to me.

I felt like I must  have hit the jackpot or  gone to heavenly bliss by accidentally venture into Garden Court Buffet! I visited Las Vegas two or three times annually and didn't discover this paradise until now. What an idiot on my part! I guess like most tourists coming to LV. We all got enticed and tourist trapped by the more expensive and classy promise eatery on the big strip. If you're on a budget or is a smart and savvy eater. This place will be a  new eatin sensory haven for u! They have all your typical buffet varieties, and some not so typical dishes which I have'nt seen in other buffets. For example, they have Peking Duck breast that are the size of  my fist. A station which cater to the Hawaiian and Filipino patrons. I thought that was a very nice touch and a smart concept, considering the amount of Asians visitin and livin there. My overall experience eatin here would only sum it up in two words. Wow!!!! Wow!!!! If U don't mind comin down to old downtown Fremont area. The Garden Buffet will be the most excellent choice to dine at. The scrumptious variety of fresh dishes and the too cheap to almost noting entrance fee just make everyone feel like a winner by eatin here. After all, Garden Court is the top five buffets voted in Vegas. So what are U waiting for? It took me 15 yrs to discover this gem! It is now my top number one buffet in Viva Vegas!

576,294,2.0,"Hello Matthew,
 You are correct, when you came by our table we did tell you things were fine. If you would have checked with your staff you would have been informed that I did complain to the server that the bacon tempura was not good prior to you coming to our table. I would have thought that he would have informed you as the place wasn't to busy. We did hear him tell the kitchen staff about it. Plus if you had looked at our plates when you came to the table, I would have thought the pile of batter on the plate would have been a clue? If you didn't see it then you surly saw it when it was cleared from the table. I didn't fell it necessary to complain twice, your staff should have informed you, that is just my opinion on that. The other thing was the server did ask about a replacement, I declined. I also paid the bill in full without any compensation for an un happy customer. 
As for you being a small busy, I am trying to do my part for you. Our first meal there was great! This is an opportunity for you to hear from your customers and maybe take a look at things that need to be tweaked or changed. 
I wish you well.
This is what Yelp is for to inform and hopefully help.",2018-03-23 18:50:48

I went in to get a table (very spacious -- loved that) and they told me it would be an hour wait and at first I was hesitant on staying and I'm glad I did because I was seated within 10-15 minutes of my arrival. If you decide you want to wait outside (as I did) they will text your phone when your table is ready. I had the cheese sliders and fries and they are soooo good! I also played it safe with the cocktails and ordered vodka and cranberry juice which was made to perfection. Everything went well with the exception of our waitress shorting me $10 on my change, but I quickly forgave her for the mistake (I hope it was a mistake). A lot of the people there (you college aged) were casual and some were really dressed up (a little older working class) and I felt so underdressed because I had scrubs on (came straight from work). I was able to get sliders, fries, and two cocktails for only $20 during happy hour... Not too bad! I highly recommend this place for a girls night or a group outing.",2015-04-25 05:54:35
1935,731,4.0,"This was a really great restaurant to start my Saturday. After a night of celebrating my birthday, I wanted something light,but satisfying to eat. I really had a taste for a croissant, but didn't see it on the menu, so I opted for the warm baguette with butter and jam on the side. While there are a plethora of menu options I could have chosen from, again, I wanted to keep things simple. There's something to be said and appreciated about an eatery that knows baguettes. The loaf was delivered warm, just asking to be buttered. Not only that, it had the perfect crusty exterior and soft, chewy interior.  When I buttered the loaf, you can see it quickly melt into all of the nooks a crannies with perfection. 

In addition to the baguette, I also ordered a single shot of espresso, which was served hot. The flavor was slightly bitter, as it should be, with a rich, intense flavor. Although I will always favor the double shot espressos of France, this was an excellent runner-up. 

I neglected to mention I was able to sit in the self-seated section of the Bloody Mary Bar which looks out onto Las Vegas Boulevard. This was such a treat because there was an hour-long wait for patio seating...this was the next best thing. To finish my light breakfast on a high note, I had to try the Bloody Mary, and not just any BM, the build-your-own sort. My bartender, Robert H. (a very pleasant and accommodating fellow), offered several tomato juices, vodkas, hot sauces and accompanying speared items such as pickles, olives, lemons, bacon slice, cheese wedge and celery stalk, of course. It tasted as great as it looked!

This is such a wonderful eatery with beautiful views, including Caesars Palace, Bellagio's fountain shows and if you like, it's a great place to simply people watch and take in The Boulevard. I had a wonderful time and I certainly will be returning.",2016-10-01 20:43:43

We tried the Tuna Lettuce Wrap, Pork Belly Sandwich, Sunchoke Spring rolls, Truffle Fried Rice, Duck Noodles and Fried Chicken.

Free diamond earrings. Okay awesome. He gets there and he feels in order to get them he has to purchase. He felt it was a scam to get people there. Which hearing it from him and how it happened I agree. So he buys my Christmas gift there so I can have the free earrings. Afterwards tells me he will never shop there again because he can get better quality jewelry at Jared. Which since I haven't seen the gift, I can't agree yet. So the fact that he had to buy something just to get it and doesn't even like the quality of the product is sad. I should've never sent him because the ""diamond earrings"" are a JOKE.

1228,694,3.0,"It pains me to give this 'ok' rating for Sweets Raku when I was the one who told my boyfriend that I desperately wanted to come here. I learned of Sweets Raku through social media, their creative and different-looking desserts intrigued me. My boyfriend was also curious and wanted to go. So we watched videos on how certain ones were made and did research of what exactly we wanted. It was a point to come to Sweets Raku during our trip just so we could experience it.  

On our visit, they did not have ANY of the desserts we planned on ordering. The Ringo and Primavera was not on the menu. I was so disappointed. There wasn't even an 'edible' menu. I had no idea this was going to happen. As I'm writing this review, it looks like their website is updated and current right now....but it wasn't when I checked earlier this year. Maybe I just have bad luck coming at a time when Sweets Raku decided to change their menu.

We were told that a new dessert Ichigo was a replacement to Ringo, so that brought my hopes up a little and we ordered that. I didn't care for the other desserts, but we wanted to get one more so I just decided on the Angel Cream because the description sounded like a safe dessert with ingredients I would like. We also got some teas to help with digestion after eating the desserts.

ICHIGO - A white chocolate shell filled with strawberries, cake, and mousse. There's also an imitation strawberry that's made of a sugar shell filled with sorbet and more mousse. We enjoyed watching Chef Mio make it. She was so delicate with her hands and the end result looked perfect and too beautiful to eat. However, all this dessert tasted like was strawberries. I love strawberries, and so does my boyfriend but I guess we were expecting something different from this. The imitation strawberry on the side was fun to crack open and eat. I really liked the sorbet inside, that gave a tangy taste and it saved this dessert from having too much sweetness from the strawberries. 

ANGEL CREAM - A dome of fromage and pear cream with white chocolate wings and a 'candy' silver halo. This was really light and creamy which I liked. But it looked and tasted too simple. Nothing to be WOW'd about. Honestly, I wish I had gotten Mars or Mount Fuji instead for a better presentation.

So we paid $12 for each dessert. That's a lot to spend on something that just LOOKS GOOD. Seriously. The desserts are not worth anything else. Taste is mediocre and we were saying there are better looking AND tasting desserts at our bakeries back home where we live. Seems like Sweets Raku's had amazing desserts in the past, and that's how they garnered all these high Yelp reviews - but I feel like they are getting lazy and less creative. The desserts on the menu now are simple and not as complex as before. 

If you don't like eating much and just want to spend money on pretty presentation and visuals, come to Sweets Raku.",2017-02-27 08:24:56

Our server never came and checked on us to see how we were doing once we got our food (our food wasn't very good) or if we needed anything! I had to be the one to flag her down and get something. I also heard her talking to her manager and she only had 2 tables!!! Us and the table next to us and basically ignored us the whole time. I don't know if she was busy or stressed but if that was the case she shouldn't be working there! I will never be back to this location! So sad!,2015-02-02 07:03:57

To me, a Burger is Good, when it doesn't need anything to make it better. Aside from my homemade burgers, these burgers are the BEST around! Tired of hearing about the Burgers? Blue32 is just a casual, great place to watch a game, have a Beer (or a few), and eat some delicious appetizers.

1135,303,4.0,"My first trip the Caledonian was a bit of a mixed bag, and if Yelp had a 3.5 star rating, I'd be inclined to lean towards it.  However, I'm going to have to settle on a 3 star. 

Ok on to the details.....

Our group showed up at the Caledonian later in the evening for a night-cap and was told that on Thursday's the bar has last call at 1am. With a statutory holiday looming on the next day, a few fellow Yelpers piped up to say, ""Even on Holy Thursday!?' 

Yes...apparently even on Holy Thursday. 

Considering the bar was fairly full with patrons looking to unwind (get drunk) without the worry of an early morning the next day it certainly came as a bit of a surprise, and I'm sure the Caledonian missed out on a boatload of extra revenue. On the bright side, the waitress was more then understanding and let us nurse our beers until 2 am. (Disclaimer: After writing that last sentence, I adjusted the Yelp rating to a 4. Must give credit, where credit is due.)

The atmosphere and feel of the Caledonian is great and while I can't speak for the food they offer, they've got a great patio out back that smells like rich, new MDF board (Disclaimer 2: I once worked at a woodworking factory. When you head out back, look up under the awning. That my friend is MDF board...and yes it was brand spanking new on my visit). 

If the weather had of been a few degrees warmer I'm sure our group would have enjoyed our beers a little more. I can easily see this patio being a big hit come summer time and hopefully the scent of new MDF has subsided.

I'm looking forward to my next trek to the Caledonian this summer to enjoy a nice cold beer on the patio......I just hope that last call on the weekends is 2am!",2011-04-23 03:21:24

1393,281,5.0,"Chef Christopher is not unlike a character crafted by (insert prolific author here). I wouldn't be surprised if his motto wasn't ""if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself."" Undoubtedly, he would wash dishes and bus tables if he could. The fact that he cannot control every second of the customer's experience is visibly painful.

The night's main course was salmon or chicken. Crippled by indecision, I finally landed on the boneless, skinless chicken, with a smear of asiago cheese, basil and garlic rolled in prosciutto. This coiled beauty lay napping in a pool of fresh corn polenta with aromatic tomato basil fennel sauce.

Cafe Monarch truly takes comfort food to the next level. My first bite was akin to stepping into a warm bath. Even the tap water tasted like home; a farm that I never grew up on. Truly honest, rustic food.

No visit to Cafe Monarch would be complete without a little chat from the Chef. He personally thanks every one of his customers for coming in and tucks away their comments and feedback for later analysis. The conversations are never disingenuous, but always intriguing. In between tiny sips of hibiscus tea from what appears to be a squat ceramic container that you store kitchen utensils in, he is quietly studying you and plotting his next meal.",2012-04-18 02:14:05

1558,406,4.0,"Very budget friendly hotel.  Stayed here because of a family reunion.  We usually stay on the strip.  The rooms were clean.  The bathrooms were very motelish.  Nothing fancy at all.  The rooms had a very modern updated look but the bathrooms were stale and old looking.  No room service available.  The rooms do not have mini fridges but you can call and request one.  One power outlet on a lamp.  Luckily we travel with a power strip and could charge our multiple devices.  

Lots of shopping and restaurants in the surrounding area.  Within the hotel they have a bowling alley, a movie theater and nice size pool.  They do sell pool passes to local residents.  We had breakfast in the buffet at 10:30 am and were told they were already serving lunch items so we had to pay the higher price.  Not really sure when they offer the $6.99 buffet as we seem to miss it the 2 times we ate there. 

If you are traveling with small kids this would be a nice budget friendly hotel.  Just traveling with 2 adults this is not your Las Vegas lights and action kinda resort.",2018-05-29 22:42:28

They mentioned he had some matting on his rear but acted like it was no big deal (which it wasn't since we comb and brush him at least weekly). I am guessing they just didn't want to spend any time brushing him so they shaved him completely. They did exactly what we said NOT to do. When I picked him up, my son and I could not even recognize him. When the groomer saw my disappointment, she said ""we don't torture animals here"" - as if he had been neglected and not ever brushed. No groomer lady, he's very loved and very well cared for. You are just lazy in not wanting to spend a few extra minutes combing him out. It doesn't hurt the pup if you grab the hair behind the comb and pull it through a tangle - but you know that. And why didn't you call us before shaving him to get our permission? Oh, right, because you are lazy and just want to push dogs through as fast as you can and collect your $45.

This was my first cirque du soleil show, and it lived up to all my expectations. We got tickets on the day of the show from those half-off discount ticket places that are scattered all along the strip. A really good bargain, we ended up paying around $75 per ticket which was discounted about 35%. Our tix were also category 3 seats (it goes up to category 4) and we were alittle worried that it would be far too back, but this was no problem at all. There is SOOO much to see, from front to back of the theater, and actually the farther back you are you can really take in and watch EVERYTHING and get a panoramic view that any seat is a good seat in my opinion, . 

I'm so glad KA was my first cirque experience. It had everything-- martial arts, trapeze, crazy acrobatics. The stage is made up of many ""mini"" stages that revolve, spin, turn over, rotates. The sheer engineering/mechanics of the stage itself is entertaining, let alone the daring performers. The story line was a bit hard to follow because I think they were speaking some made-up imaginary language.

1766,609,4.0,"The one expectation I went in was that I was going to pay quite a bit of money for not-as-much food; such is the realm of tapas sometimes. That expectation was pretty much shattered upon leaving. 

The service was very friendly and attentive, and went above and beyond as to explain what each dish contained, without compromising the secret ingredients :) The two biggest dishes left on my mind and palate were the sunchoke spring rolls with roasted truffle mayo, along with the almond tofu cheesecake with blueberry ginger compote and almond butter. The spring rolls defies the regular image of a spring roll using phyllo pastry, which also complimented the sunchoke filling. The roasted truffle mayo gave a nice umami kick to the spring rolls.

The tofu cheesecake was light, fluffy and not too sweet, to my delight. the blueberry ginger compote helped to alleviate any heaviness (if any), from the cheesecake, ending the meal with a very pleasant high note.

Yes, you will be paying around $11-30, but... the service, the experience, and most of all, the food makes it all worth it. They are set to unveil a new menu very soon, so keep an eye out!",2018-03-01 01:47:20

Today is my 11th wedding anniversary, and my amazing wife suggested we try LMB for our anniversary celebration.  Am I the luckiest guy in the world or what?

Ok, the line sucks.  The parking sucks.  Doesn't matter.  One taste of the food and all that stuff melts away like the glistening hunks of delicious brisket melts in your mouth.

We tried the fatty brisket, pulled pork, sausage, pork ribs, and the daily special beef short ribs on the bone.  For sides, we got the beans, grits (amazing), and potato salad.  

All of the meats are wonderful, perfectly smoked with a peppery bark.  The beef rib was remarkably unctuous and flavorful.  The fatty brisket though.  Damn.  It's succulent, incredible, simply the best piece of BBQ I've ever experienced.  I literally am starting to drool as I write this review and am reminiscing on the brisket.

Oh...and here is a good tip...get the pickles.  They are fantastic and and provide a perfect sharp crispy cold counterpoint to the glorious meat candy.

The price is not cheap.  Doesn't matter.  They are using only prime meat and you can instantly tell the difference.  Their product is worth the premium.

Also, I can't forget about the good folks who run this joint.  Everyone we encountered was so nice and wore their passion for the BBQ proudly on their sleeves.  Special kudos to the older gentleman who was expertly orchestrating the parking lot & told us all about what to try and some of the history while we were in line, and also the guy working the smokers.  He invited my wife back to show her the process he uses with the brisket, what an awesome treat!

Ok, I've gone on long enough.  A gold star for you if you're still actually reading this far down in the review.  Why are you still reading this?  Get in your car & head downtown to LMB.  The line is already forming, hurry!",2016-01-30 04:01:36

Driving up, I couldn't tell whether it was open or not.  It does seem a bit like a truck stop/diner, but have no fear and enter through the doors.  The staff is quite friendly and will take good care of you.  The interior isn't much to look at, but it's clean and comfortable.  The food is where SNS surprisingly shines.

I admit I was a little disappointed that I missed breakfast - switches over to lunch at 10am - as I was 45 minutes too late.  A bit grumpy, I had to put on my big boy pants and ""settle"" for a brisket sandwich and fries.  To my delight, the brisket was delicious.  Not quite a Texas style brisket, but really good regardless.  The side of fries was also amazing - some of the best I've had in a while.

Only complaint is my rye and ginger felt like it didn't have much rye in it (I find this a common issue everywhere... Maybe it's maybe baby face who knows) 
My friend and I had the fish board.  Favorite was definitely the tuna.  All 3 fish dishes were incredible, the combination of flavors is great and everything worked well together. 
Next was the truffle gnudi,  my favorite of all 3 dishes. I'll be honest I hate mushrooms and did not want to get this. This changed everything....  I would go back just for this honestly. 
Lastly the burger....  Yeah one of best burgers you can get.  Really juicy, flavourful, and like every other dish all the components worked well together.

I swear I look like a dang fairy coming out of there. Going in as a 6 and coming out as an 11 lol. Anyways, I tried a different location because I found a groupon code for that specific place, (I love deals and coupons) but lashes weren't their specialty. So I reverted back since they opened their new location on LV Blvd. I got a great deal but was worried that I wasn't able to get an appointment time since it was a bit late notice and very close to my departure date. Any who, I called and they worked with me. I was so so so so so so thankful for the appointment maker and boss, and my eyelash stylist DALINE! Granted I had no stinkin idea what I wanted because I always forget, but she recommended what would last longest and what would look best on my original lashes. I am so very impressed with the way they turned out, I have nothing but amazing things to say about my visit. By the way, if you're wondering if you could trust your original lashes with these women, yes.. You definitely can. Every time I've had extensions put in here my lashes have come back the same as before. Just look at my before pic. If you want quality care, quality product, rest assured, this is the place. Have a great FANTA-bulous day! Ciao!",2016-08-07 10:57:15

Try the Ahi taco's for Happy Hour!

The fries couldn't be any better. They were crispy, covered with plenty of guac and sour cream, and topped with the fresh cut pork right off of the spinning pole. I don't know how to explain the uniqueness of the meat, but it was kind of a hybrid of bacon and cha siu (chinese pork). It was crispy like bacon and flavorful like cha siu. omgiwantsomemore!",2013-01-02 23:48:12

1429,557,5.0,"Located off the strip in Downtown Las Vegas, the crowd and vibes are way more relaxed. 
This spot was a little tricky to find but when we finally did, we were so glad we didn't give up! 
One of the employees met us outside and recognized our look of confusion and showed us the way.

We were seated indoors right away at a communal high top table because we desperately needed AC. But if you love the sun, you can eat on the outdoor rooftop patio and bar. 

The first thing I noticed were the actual menus which were so unique. I immediately knew that the food would be amazing because if someone puts that much thought into a menu, then they've definitely put a lot of thought and care into crafting delicious cocktails and dishes.

We ordered the Machu Peach-U cocktail. It was a peachy take on a Peruvian Pisco sour, with Smith & Cross Jamaica rum, Giffard crème de pêche, Barso pisco, fresh lemon & lime, bar keep saffron bitters, and finished with a fluffy egg white on top. I loved it!

Our first appetizer was the KILLER SHRIMP with rocoto & aji amarillo pepper cream. It looked and tasted similarly to Walnut Shrimp from a Chinese restaurant, minus the walnuts, and had a spicy kick at the end.  

Our second app were the PORK WINGS with buffalo bleu beurre blanc. They were the most succulent juicy pork belly bites dipped in a little buffalo sauce. They were finger licking good!!

Next we ordered the baked mac n cheese. I'm not sure what cheeses were used but it was creamy, dreamy, delicious. 

Our entrée was the COCOA-ESPRESSO NY STRIP with red wine demi. It was perfection! I couldn't distinguish the cocoa or espresso flavors, but they must've worked well together because I took pleasure in each juicy bite. 

Dessert... Oh, my...
I love donuts. I love bread pudding. And yes, 
they actually made a GLAZED DONUT BREAD PUDDING!!!! It was almost shaped like a mushroom- the top was donut and it became softer at the base, almost like flan. I had the biggest smile of sheer bliss on my face and I closed my eyes to make the flavors and that feeling last as long as possible.

Seafood choices are just that. Sides are extra. Any seafood you order is somewhat spicy as their basic choice, then you can choose to have it more spicy, but not less spicy. Seafood is served in plastic bags...no plates offered. My husband enjoyed his BBQ, but not enough to choose this place for BBQ. We won't be back.

I've read other reviewers raves about Barb. Either got a different Barb or she was having an off night.

1005,771,5.0,"5 stars is for the room. The wrap around terrace room to be exact.  Make sure your room is in the East Tower.  While I am sure the West Tower is nice, the long walk back by the convention meeting room areas seems so desolate.

The hotel itself has a nice location and has a good mix of semi-casual restaurants on the 4th floor.  If you want to try something unique, book a reservation at Rose Rabbit Lie.  The dinner theatre will be a first for most people.  The hotel Is currently the choice of the upscale non-clubbing scene between the late 20s-50 year old set crowd of pretty people.  If you decide to go casual with a t-shirt and shorts, you will look terribly foolish and probably feel uncomfortable.

Gambling area has distracting female dancers in an array of black catsuits to take your mind off of any card counting you're doing.  The Chandelier Bar is a great 2 story social bar set in the middle of the hotel.  Do keep an eye out for the ""local talent"" as my friend thought he was getting lucky until he found it might cost him something extra.  Anyhow, I find this bar to be the one I end up at even when staying at other hotels.

The rooms are fairly priced. A recent 6 day stay cost $2200 for a room that was high grade during a busy convention time.   The wraparound balcony faced the Bellagio and we were treated to a nightly water show.  The bedroom opened out to the balcony so you could sit outside as you deemed suitable.  The bathroom has both a jacuzzi tub for two and a large glass shower with dual sinks and a separate water closet.  

The room also comes with a full kitchenette and lounge and entertainment center.  Although you probably won't do any cooking, the suite allows you all the room to entertain a small party or to keep separate if one person wants to retire early or sleep in.

My daughter went back in to have the bacon added and pay for it if necessary. Here's where it goes south.... instead of hearing the bacon and adding it to the sandwiches the decision was made to add it to the croissants and re heat them causing the croissants to get very dark and crispy on the outside. Now what sense did that make? And why would you ever do that to those delicious croissants. Ugh... so rather than going back in we've decided to never return.

551,64,2.0,"Long wait and nothing special about the food from Noodle Asia. Service is slow and waitress was rude. Everytime we asked a question to the waitress her attitude was that she was so high above everyone else, and was simply answering our question just because she wants to get paid.

We had the Hot and Sour soup, Beef fried rice, and the BBQ Pork and Duck.

The Hot and Sour soup was pretty good, tasted like all the other chain Chinese restaurants here in Canada.

The Beef fried rice was also pretty good, well seasoned, nice beef taste

The BBQ Pork and Duck I was very disappointed with.
The first bite I took was greeted with a million sharp shards of bones. Both the Pork and Duck were really dry, and of course served with some even drier rice.  Another problem is the rice to meat ratio. You can tell this restaurant does not care about details or quality when they just shoved about 3 bowls of rice onto a plate topped with a couple pieces of meat. I'm not complaining about the meat, I would have rather they  not give me a bunch of rice which I am not going to eat. I am Asian and when you eat meat with your rice you usually take a bite of the meat, and a spoonful of rice. Well that's what I did (the meat and rice were very dry I had to drink a cup of water after each bite) and I did not even finish half the rice, not even a quarter.

Very disappointed, wasn't worth the 30 minute line outside for food I could have gotten at a chain Chinese restaurant.",2014-01-29 05:20:54

688,277,4.0,"I'm going to start with four stars for the Castle. We booked here last weekend and the spot is amazing. I love the feel and the idea of the greenery and artifacts in the back which give for great after-ceremony photos (exactly what most of the venues in the city are missing). My biggest gripe is with their 'soft holds policy'. Personally, I have no issues with this. So, after touring on a Saturday and falling in love, I tell them my fiancé and I will be back the next weekend with family because we want to lock down our October date that is still open. They tell us thats great, set an appointment, but again make it clear they cannot do a 'soft hold'. 

The following Saturday 9 of us show up. Tell them we're probably going to book, and they mention another bride is INTERESTED...There are no soft holds though, so it shouldn't matter-right? So while I'M there touring with my family, the owner calls the other bride telling her there is someone else touring that is REALLY interested (I witnessed the call first-hand when I walked in to their office to ask for pricing to show my dad whom hadn't seen it). The owner is on the phone for a long while, and comes back to say 'the other bride is on her way down (!!!!!) but it's whoever gets the money in our hand first that gets the date, since we don't do soft holds'. When my dad says alright, we're ready, the owner says 'I don't want you making a rash decision because you feel pressure'. 

At this point I'm almost ready to cry out of pure frustration, and tell the owner point blank, 'If we walk out now so you can talk to the other bride, we will not be back'. 

Ultimately we got the date we wanted, and the other bride got her secondary date, and came over to congratulate us after booking. Kudos to the other bride, but hopefully The Castle owners will provide for a better experience going forward and not make us regret investing thousands in this place. 

Will update as things progress, and hopefully be able to increase the stars because I do think the place is absolutely stunning.",2013-12-07 02:44:34

832,807,1.0,Very disappointed. We came to dine and usually my wife or me will get a table while the other orders our meal. Well the cashier male who is always congenial with us told my husband in front of everyone to hold off sitting at a table. We were embarrassed and left the establishment. Long story short we thought seating was first come first serve and feel this treatment was unnecessary. We ended up eating at Mimi's.,2017-01-21 21:16:50

Visits: one, lunch

Breads - They give you a basket with a couple different types of bread. Nice! Something for everyone. The best of the bunch was the jalapeno cheese bread. LOVED it. Cornbread really was very crumbly, and it was also slightly salty, which was odd. I like my cornbread sweet, thanks.

Blue Corn Pancake - Eh. Thought the sauce was a little weird....

Tiger Prawn Tamale - Oh man was that delicious. And the corn was so yummy, but it's really filling so be careful with that one as an appetizer.

Sophie's salad - Great! I love fruity dressings and cheese.

Crab pancakes - You certainly do get a lot of crab, but I wasn't wowed by it. Very filling.

Pork tenderloin - I don't know if it was supposed to be cold, but I don't like my meat cold unless it is sandwich ""meat"". Had an interesting flavor, but eh.

Cuban burger - SOOOOO GOOOOOOOD. I don't even like mustard (I told the waiter no dijon, and he said that was the one thing they couldn't take out...) but man was that burger good. I didn't even really taste the dijon.

Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash - Okay, so I don't know if it's just me, but when I see ""hash"" I think like hash browns or maybe some sort of sweet potato fries... What we got was more like ""mash,"" and it was actually mixed in with the chicken.  Kind of gross in my opinion.  Really sweet, not spicy at all.

Coconut layer cake - TO DIE FOR. So moist and delicious. And you get a gigantic slice. Enough for two or more people depending on how full you are.

Chocolate creme brulee with blueberry compote - OMNOMNOMNOM.  The chocolate at the bottom of the creme brulee really makes it even better.",2010-08-30 06:11:12
791,866,2.0,"I'm not a huge fan.

I don't gamble and so this review is not for the casino. I am reviewing this as a Doubletree hotel.

I came to Vegas for a conference, and decided to stay at a Hilton property.  If you are in that boat, and just want a nice Hilton hotel, I would not stay here.

It smells terrible.  When you first walk in the front doors, you are affronted by (a) smoke, and (b) something that smells like womens' perfume being used to cover said smoke.

The casino is really, really sad.  Lots and lots of elderly people addicted to gaming. At other casinos on the strip I saw lots of young folks -- definitely not here.  Average age probably about 60, and it just felt terrible to see so many fixed incomes going down the drain.

I got a room back in the secondary tower (they have 2).  It was a good 10 minute walk from the main entrance. Which was annoying, because they didn't have any sort of exit to the street from that tower -- they make you walk all the way back through the smelly casino just to get out.

Unfortunately like a number of Doubletrees (unlike the lower-priced Hamptons, ironically), the A/C doesn't allow the fan to be forced on.  I like to leave a fan running as background noise to help me sleep.  There was a fan in the bathroom that was perfect for this, but it also was configured to be force-connected to the light switch.  Evil.

Restaurants were so-so, and expensive. There is a Starbucks onsite, which is worth a second star.  The other restaurants weren't anything to write home about.

I had heard a lot about the amazing pool.  It was fine, but if it is the best on the strip, that would surprise me.",2014-08-10 23:27:19

168,463,2.0,"I've stayed here about five times since the place opened a liittle over two years ago and I used to like the place a lot.  Unfortunately as other reveiwers have noted over the last six months a new management team has taken over and I have noted a lot of changes for the worse.  Downtown Grand's new penny pinching is likely to put the place into a death spiral.

They raised the resort fee from 11 to 22 dollars a nights and now charge $7 to valet park even if you are staying in the hotel.  Way to drive away your loyal customers geniuses.    Self parking is still free for guests but it is in a decrepit older structure a block away.  Trust me you don't want to do that.  It's littered with empty booze bottles and has outdated elevators that look like they were taken from Fallujah bomb shelters.  If you survive that you get to lug your suitcases for about ten minutes to check in.  Nah, I'll just pay the 7 bucks.  Strike one.

The City Suite rooms are still nice and still have the floor to ceiling windows for great views of the surrounding area.  However, I noticed one of the sinks had a broken latch and was stuck in the closed position.  Deferred maintenance is usually a sign of a struggling hotel.  Strike two.

The showers still have the stupid half doors.  In the past I've always stayed here in the spring or summer when it's like 100 degrees out so being cold wasn't a problem.  However during my last visit in December it was like 30 degrees out so the taking a shower with cold air pouring in on your is no fun.  Even if you crank the heat up in the room beforehand it's still cold in the shower.

For me the worst change is they shrunk the gaming pit area in half so they now only have four blackjack tables available.  During Christmas week one evening they had no seats available at any of the three 10 or 15 dollar tables, and one table priced at 100 minimum with no players and a dealer standing there doing nothing.  While waiting for a spot to open I saw at least four people ask the pit boss to lower the limit at the 100 table so they could play, only to be denied.  After a few minutes of watching this management stupidity I gave up and decided to go play somewhere else.  Strike three.

Are you trying to become a slots only parlor or do you want to stay a real casino?  If so please add some more tables and hire some more dealers.  Otherwise two years from now I'm sure you'll be bankrupt and/or out of business.",2016-01-05 08:52:11
1058,305,4.0,"This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem located around 20 minutes northwest of the Vegas Strip. We dropped by for a quick brunch, not knowing how long we were going to spend at Red Rock Canyon. I knew a lot of  people in the area rave about this place so I definitely had to try it out. It was packed to the brim on a Tuesday morning, which shocked me! They have everything from sandwiches to meats to breads and of course everyone's favorite, their pastries. Service was so/so but I would understand because the restaurant was so busy. There are newspapers in the front that look like daily news but it is actually their gigantic menu so it took us awhile for us to decide what we wanted. 

I ended up getting their Smoked Turkey with Avocado, Tomato, and Bacon, which only comes in the bigger half pound portions. Be warned because I was expecting a small bite but their sandwiches are huge and is pretty much 1.5x meals for me but there is absolutely no sharing! Their turkey was a little dry but I'm glad they didn't skimp on the amount of turkey they gave. I was surprised that they gave a pickle beside the sandwich because I'm a huge fan of pickles but I only ended up eating half of it because of how salty it was. With the sandwich, you have a choice of a side, which I chose potato salad and it was on the creamier side, which I didn't mind.

252,35,4.0,"My hubby and I stayed at the Venetian during the week last week. The price was great (169/night) with a package that included $40 off the Phantom of the Opera show tickets! We were definitely planning on seeing it, so it was perfect! There were other discounts in the package (to an Asian restaurant and a Mexican one at Palazzo) but we didn't use those. 

The Venetian...OMG, I loved that place! The perfume scent that others complain about in their reviews, actually wasn't bad...I was worried about it, being highly allergic to strong smelling perfumes, but it was actually really nice...I even miss it now...I didn't sneeze at all from it. We arrived early, 2pm, and they checked is in no problem (3pm is checkin)...Our room was very-very nice, my hubby's jaw sort of dropped when he first saw the room (I booked the whole thing so I already saw the pictures). It was very spacious, from the bathroom to the bedroom/living room...3 TVs in the place! I subtracted a star though b/c our TV in the bathroom did not work :( I was bummed b/c being a woman I spend a LOTTA time in there :) 

The pool area on the 4th floor was very nice (there's another pool with more shade and more privacy on the 10th floor too)...I didn't check out Tao Beach, because I didnt even realize that was in a different area until later. My hubby walked by it and said it was nothing major, so I believed him. There were sufficient chairs at the pool, and the waitresses came by occasionally to see if anyone needed drinks. They could've made more money personally if they came by more frequently. Drinks were good, and the restaurant (Riva by Wolfgang Puck) has really good lunch menu (Pizza was great, and their salads too).

I came here based on reviews while wandering downtown after getting out of business trip obligations early, and it was a perfect place for a solo dinner with a couple beers.

The interior is cool, a modern take on a classic bistro look with the same posters and warm ambiance but high ceilings, couch seating at some tables, and cool lighting. Of note: a sweet chef's counter you can sit at in the back that overlooks the kitchen.

Great selection of local brews and cool upscale food, all with suggested beer pairings, or beer in the food! I had a ""devil's puttanesca"" mussel bowl - think mussels made with pasta puttanesca ingredients with a pale ale instead of a white wine. Seriously good mussels, and seriously great broth with extra bread to soak it up delivered upon request. Sweet.

576,294,2.0,"Hello Matthew,
 You are correct, when you came by our table we did tell you things were fine. If you would have checked with your staff you would have been informed that I did complain to the server that the bacon tempura was not good prior to you coming to our table. I would have thought that he would have informed you as the place wasn't to busy. We did hear him tell the kitchen staff about it. Plus if you had looked at our plates when you came to the table, I would have thought the pile of batter on the plate would have been a clue? If you didn't see it then you surly saw it when it was cleared from the table. I didn't fell it necessary to complain twice, your staff should have informed you, that is just my opinion on that. The other thing was the server did ask about a replacement, I declined. I also paid the bill in full without any compensation for an un happy customer. 
As for you being a small busy, I am trying to do my part for you. Our first meal there was great! This is an opportunity for you to hear from your customers and maybe take a look at things that need to be tweaked or changed.

It was topped with tomatoes and a vinaigrette type dressing. The Full Montague had roast beef, turkey, cheese, tomatoes. The bread was really good, they were hot sammys, so it came toasted.

Everything was not bad, and the service was impeccable. The runny egg on the croque madame was cooked to perfection, neither being too runny or too over cooked. The french toast came in a mini tower much to our surprise. We split it delightfully and the chicken and waffles, while not being fried chicken was roasted to a great savory moistness mixed with the sweet syrup and spongy waffle was a great

My boyfriend told me he was going to take me to Little Miss BBQ and said it was ""the best BBQ,"" which was quite a claim to make. For the few times, he is right: Little Miss BBQ is the best best BBQ I've ever ever had.

Even in the blistering 110 deg heat, lines started to form around the shop 20 minutes before it opened at 11AM. They gave out free cold bottle water and passed out samples of the sausages intermittently, which only teased us even more with their tasty food. All the staff here are friendly and would come out to your table to ask how your experience was and talk to people waiting in line. From the line, you can see the rows of large BBQ/ smoke pits they use to cook their meats. Each smoker was large enough to smoke any pig, cow, or me in it. Impressive.

The line moves slowly as there is only one assembly line for food and cashier. Even though we came in 20 minutes before it opened, we were in line for a good hour at least! But believe me, it is worth the wait. When you get into the shop, you'll see the guy hand carve the meat for you. We got the sausage, brisket, pulled pork, and pork ribs. Everything is sold by the pound or per sausage. It was quite convenient as you can customize how much food you want. By far, our favorite was the brisket. It was so tender and juicy; you'll see when the carver slices through the meat like tomatoes.

What horrible service! Our orders came out wrong, the food was bland. Won't be going to this location again. Don't waste your time at this location.",2018-07-19 08:27:30
344,48,3.0,"Let me explain. There aren't many genuine Philly cheesesteak places in AZ, this is one that come close. There are only 2 in the valley I can do, the other is DeFalcos in Scottsdale.
There's not enough cheese and meat inside for my personal taste. I'm still left a little hungry after 8 inches. Otherwise the overall taste is great!
The employees are all pretty much family. They're Very friendly! However, wait time is tremendous. 15-25min for your food. Don't come in a rush.

I noticed him acknowledging several other customers by name and exchanging pleasantries with them as well.

1673,493,3.0,"I'd put down 5 stars just for the amazing baked goods they have. But the service I received was just unprofessional and uncalled for. If I didn't ask to someone to cash me out, as I was only getting a loaf of pepperoni bread; which is amazingly good by the way; I'd have just left empty handed. I completely understand and get that they are constantly busy all day, every day. But that fact remains, you don't ignore a customer who is awaiting to check out at the cash register. I almost assumed that just because I wasn't wearing a suite and tie, or dressed, excuse the reference but it is all that fits; preppy looking. I was ignored completely! I had to ask for someone to come over and sell me an item.

354,626,5.0,"This has got to be by far the nicest hotel I've stayed in during my stints in Vegas. It is kind of amazing inside.

We get there late and find that they have given up our room. Ok so we're off to a poor start, the front desk tries to ask us to pay for an upgrade to another room, but hello this is not our fault, so with that reasoning we get bumped up. 

We walk in and it is an astonishing view. Our room on the 50th floor faces the golf course and the beautiful waterfall behind it. The room is stunning with floor to ceiling windows and decorative mirrors. The shades are drawn by buttons in the middle console next to the beds. Not only are there 2 queen beds, there are two sinks and a vanity. There's a LCD in the bathroom, plasma in the main room and the alarm clock is an iHome iPod player that can charge our iPhones with. The room is amazing.

Downstairs there are several late dining facilities and stores that open till midnight and serve drinks like mimosas and sparkling wine while you peruse the products. I get giddy just thinking about how nice it was. 

The staff and promoters here were also very helpful. Being guests there we had instant access to the club, which opens up onto their outdoor waterfall. While the music was subpar which I find with many Vegas clubs the view was fabulous and the drinks were good.

I had an amazing time staying here. It doesn't matter that it's at the end of the strip, it's just one of the nicest places to stay and besides we took cabs everywhere we went so who cares about walking around?",2009-05-20 06:31:52

I get the feeling we'd still be standing there had I not said anything. 

I'm unsure what our server sounds like because the only word she muttered was ""sure"" when I asked for both the calamari and spaghetti to be served at the same time. 
She literally did not say ANYTHING else.
Not when I asked for a refill not when I said thank you as she dropped off the check... nothing.

Our server, Sara (sp? maybe Sarah?) was prompt and courteous, and the food was great.  We started off with the Kansas City burnt end appetizer, which was definitely the best that we've had in Vegas (but still not quite up to snuff with Char Bar in Kansas City https://www.yelp.com/biz/char-bar-kansas-city-2).  The bark ws smoky and sweet and meat was tender with just the right amount of fat for some great flavor.  My wife got the short ribs, which she loved, and I went with a 1/2 order of brisket.  After our last visit, I specifically asked for some meat on the leaner side.  What I got was a bit dry, but that may have been my own fault for asking for lean.  It was still tasty though!  The fries with the white sauce were excellent and the cornbread and butter were delightful.  The fries still came out a little after the rest of our meal, but I could live with that.  Most important for this visit were that the glaring issues had been addressed (yes, we actually got barbecue sauce with our meats).  We'll definitely be back.",2016-03-28 18:43:43

856,846,3.0,"Kind of the -Days Inn- of the strip. If I were to suddenly polka dot, nay, spray can paint you with random epithets, I'd say this place is family oriented, underwhelming in the gaming area department, corporate-feeling, astonishingly affordable for the location and unmemorable compared to what you can possibly spoil yourself with on other parts of the strip.

Parking here kind of blows. They make you feel second rate from the get-go. You can self-park and when you get to the elevator, you have to walk through Paris (not a bad thing really, but time consuming) to get to the Bally's registration area, which always seems to have long queues. 

We stayed in the newly renovated North Tower, deluxe room. Averaging $77 a night for Monday and Tuesday nights, I feel like the hotel could have averaged $30 a night had we stayed longer. The luck I had in Vegas made me rue the day a bit.

That said, the deluxe room just seemed to lack the amenities I had taken for granted as a guest at Mandalay Bay and the Palms in the past. No refrigerator, big boxy television, a tub for a bath and not even a couch to lay down on. The beds DO make up for it and are rather comfortable and spic 'n' span clean.

601,632,4.0,"After Baker to Vegas this weekend, my husband and I hit this place up for a good and cheap dinner.  We were covered in dust and looked like desert rats, but the mixture of clientele at Tacos El Gordo was less than judgmental and I felt quite welcome.

The restaurant (on a Saturday night around 8ish) was brightly lit and chaotic with patrons.  The long lines meant a long wait, especially for adobada, which is much, much better than the carne asada, which is good but not great.  

The homemade tortillas are about the size of your palm.  A taco with everything comes with meat, onions, cilantro, lime, salsa and a smooth avocado sauce that wasn't exactly guacamole.  I also had a quesadilla, which is the same thing as a taco but with good white cheese stuck to the tortilla and a fried tortilla on top.  

Order your tacos first, then go pay at the cashier to get your cups for drinks.  There's a soda machine and an horchata machine, the kind with the happy face logo that says ""Ole!""

The fries with meat (carne asada, adobada, or a mixture of the two which is called campechana, I think) is a three-pound box filled with everything your cardiologist doesn't want you to eat.  Cheese, fries, crema, meat.  You can share this among four people and you will probably still not finish it.

Tacos are two dollars each.  A meal with a drink will be about $10-12 dollars, which is a lot for a taco joint.

However, the people watching is first-rate.  Besides Mexican families and the occasional adventurous Midwesterner, customers include hotel workers, drunken frat boys, and honest-to-goodness prostitutes.  At the table next to ours, there was a lively and profanity-spangled discussion in Spanish about the true definition of a chilango.  On the patio, a group of young men in their early-twenties with matching vests and threaded eyebrows fortified themselves before a night of what would no doubt be the liberal distribution of rohypnol.  All of these people and more you will find at the Las Vegas Strip Tacos El Gordo.  All united in taco solidarity.  This is a good place.",2013-04-16 20:56:17

Everything was done quickly, despite the fact that the joint was packed to the gills with a mixed crowd of gay couples, college students, middle aged folks and families.

808,166,2.0,"Wanted to stop somewhere for a quick bite before a show last night.  First choice had a huge line waiting to get in (place just opened), so I continued down the strip and ended up at 800 Degrees.

Really cool concept, you walk in, and there's a guy working the pizza dough (all pies are same size, 12"").  When he's finished, your dough moves to the next station: sauce, cheese, the basics.  Then if you'd like to add any more ingredients you can for $1.50 each.  I chose the basic Margherita pizza, reasonably priced @ under $8.  Move down the line, pay for your order, and your pie goes into the 800+ degree oven.  It's cooked in a couple minutes, and your ready to eat.

At first I was kinda disappointed when I picked up the first slice and all the toppings slid off.  However, upon further investigation (there's a brochure right by the entrance), I learned that you're supposed to eat this type of pie with a knife & fork, I guess that's ""Neopolitan"" style.   Once I armed myself with the proper utensils, it was a much better experience.  The pizza was a little soggier than I would like, but it did have a nice flavor, the crust was great.  It did get cold a bit quicker than expected, however.  My last couple slices were at room temperature by the time I finished.

Overall, I'd say this place is a decent value, especially for a strip eatery.  Definitely better than a Sbarro, or other franchise place. However, as a LV local, I'll probably stick to my neighborhood joints in the future.",2015-01-18 17:53:09

216,152,4.0,"I'm actually giving this place 3.5 stars.

The place is really good for sushi. We got the lunch special which is order an appetizer or nigiri and then 2 rolls for $9.99.  Me and my brother order 4 rolls and 3 out of those 4 were really good...the last one (the triple ocean...I think it was called)...the sauce was overpowering. 

One thing was bothering me was that I got my one order roll...and then got my appetizer....and then my 2nd roll. This was fine but the appetizer should be the first item out...that is why it is called an appetizer. (I do have to say that the gyoza appetizer was lacking seasoning...I mostly was tasting green onions...and that's it)  Like it said it didn't bother me that much because all of our food came out in a quickly matter.

However, the main problem of this restaurant is the decor and layout.  When you walk in...you are greeted by a wall and makes the entrance cramped and unwelcoming.  If they knocked down that wall...it will make the restaurant more 'open' and inviting.  Plus the decor is tacky and the paint seems to fade a little bit.  The ceilings tiles should be clean a little bit.

My friend picked up an awesome looking sandwich of provolone cheese and prosciutto with the tiny french pickles.  I went back the second day and bought that while my friends went to buffets.  It was so worth the trip by myself.  I got that and had my own water.

So, we headed that way, an hour out of our way and would absolutely do it again if I was in the area again.  The combination or the food and service, made the trip absolutely worth it.  The food is a plenty but it all looked so good, we did not hold back.  We ordered the garden hash which came with organize veggies, the potatoes were fantastic and the other veggies were not overcooked, with this for a $2.00 up charge, I ordered the cinnamon bun, which they put in a to-go box, as I knew I would not have room and they were happy to do that.  We also had the Popeye Omelet that had spinach and cheese a plenty, doing an up charge for the French Toast, which they fry.  If you like funnel cake, which is somewhat how they described it, which was completely accurate, you will love it.  If you like more traditional french toast, this may not be how you like it but it was a neat take on french toast.

It has a menu comparable to legume in the sense that everything is made with the freshest seasonal ingredients.  However...I prefer legume.

- Spare ribs with BBQ sauce 
- Smoked tuna strawberry salad 

Both were delicious.  The spare ribs were meat falling off the bone tender and the sauce was bbq sauce but more refined.  The smoked tuna on the salad made the appetizer worth it. 

For my main course: 
- arctic char and scallops with couscous 

The arctic char was nothing special but the scallops were AMAZING, unquestionably FRESH. Best part of the meal hands down (too bad there were only 2 pieces).  A friend had the ribeye which was also very tasty.

I ended up getting their Smoked Turkey with Avocado, Tomato, and Bacon, which only comes in the bigger half pound portions. Be warned because I was expecting a small bite but their sandwiches are huge and is pretty much 1.5x meals for me but there is absolutely no sharing! Their turkey was a little dry but I'm glad they didn't skimp on the amount of turkey they gave. I was surprised that they gave a pickle beside the sandwich because I'm a huge fan of pickles but I only ended up eating half of it because of how salty it was.

Full disclosure, Chicago is famous for their deep dish, but has tons of great NY Style pizza which is my personal favorite. This isn't a deep dish pizza review. Hanny's has incredible NY Style pizza. The cracker crust was fantastic. Just the right amount of crunch without going overboard. I don't know what kind of cheese mixture they use, but it is delicious. The sauce is equally delicious. I took the pizza back to my hotel room and they provided small containers of parmesan cheese, red peppers, and some oregano. I sprinkled a little of all three on and had pizza perfection.

Since my first taste, I have been a weekly customer. Usually choosing a new flavor of macaroon and always the fig and goat cheese (thankfully, that is a regular flavor.) You cannot go wrong with Gimme Some Sugar. 

Go in - get a treat (or two), sip a coffee, and enjoy the beautiful display of amazing cakes. These girls are so talented - you will be a regular too.",2014-03-14 17:34:56

Phillip was a great waiter and offered great suggestions and information regarding the menu.

If you let your waiter know that you are celebrating a special occasion, they will give you a free drink or dessert. We celebrated my friend's birthday there and got a free plate of mochi and fruity ice cream.

The only reason I don't give this place five stars is that you really do not get much food at all for the price. The sushi rolls are tasty, but quite small.",2013-09-04 01:50:05
1625,401,3.0,"I want to give this place 5 stars. If you would have asked me a few years back, it would have been hands down 5 stars. The desserts here are to die for. 

Before I lived in Charlotte, my beau would take me here on my visits to the city. The baby blue, lost-in-wonderland theme was charming and I wanted one of everything on the menu. While it's a bit pricey, they also serve french press coffee that is every bit worth the price.

That said, the experience has lost it's luster in my past few visits. Amelie's was becoming well known and deservingly so. Every pastry I've had from them was absolutely divine. Who wouldn't want to come here?

Perhaps I've just come at cosmic peak hours, but the lines had grown to Disneyland proportions in my recent visits. The cashiers started to come down the line to take our orders before we were anywhere near the glass cases to look at our options. How am I supposed to know what I want when I haven't even seen it yet? In both my last visits, they also informed us in the line that it would be 30-45 minutes if we wanted to order a sandwich or anything not pastry. While understandable with the crowd to staff ratio, this was kind of disappointing. 

The inside decor of this place is lovely. Lots of artsy kitchy stuff and cozy couches. However as busy as it was, there was nary a seat in the place. My last couple visits involved devouring a pastry in the enclosed strip mall alley behind the building. Because I've lost hope of enjoying the experience of this place, I no longer go to Amelies. Which is a shame because they have some damned good pastries on their menu.",2014-12-16 21:01:27

1779,764,4.0,"I may have almost shed a tear when I found out an O.H.S.O would be going in at Tatum and Shea. I waited (sorta) patiently, and finally got to eat there yesterday evening. I was happy that there was a sizable crowd when I arrived at 9 PM on a Wednesday. God bless late night eateries. And super god bless late night eateries that just so happen to also be breweries- YES!

5 stars for ambience! How in the world did they turn that unassuming, bland strip-mall location into something wonderful with great character?! It reminds me of the Vig uptown and the Yard. The design is more creative than the other two locations, and much larger. Also, as an ex-Boing employee, I appreciate the giant helicopter blade fans!

Of course, as the place just opened, there are still a lot of kinks to work out. I had been hearing rumblings in my neighborhood about warm beer, messed up orders, and bad service. My husband and I ended up experiencing some of that as well. I ordered the Summertime Cocktail, a muddled basil drink, and they forgot the the basil! Maybe that's karma for not ordering beer at a brewery? My waiter was nice of course and brought out a new one. Our table took ""wobbly"" to a new dimension. It was as if it was missing a leg entirely. It was a good laugh though, it almost felt like we were being set up on a hidden camera show.

My husband, who has the largest appetite of anyone we've ever met, ordered the diablo burger and only ate half! Good value. I got the blackened salmon tacos. Salmon is not normally my favorite fish for tacos, however, this really worked! The seasoning and flavor was nice. This too was a hardy portion for fish tacos. My only complaint was the under-seasoned, very soggy coleslaw. I'm guessing everything will vastly improve in the coming months.

I've definitely had worse experiences at newly opened restaurants (eg: the opening of Pomo at Gainey Ranch, sheer disaster, twice.)

2. Lobster with XO sauce:  plentiful with lots of yummy flavors.  Can be spicy depending on the jalapeños.

3. Salt and pepper squid: perfectly battered pieces of squid (no legs though-boooo), deep fried to absolute perfection!

4. Beef Chow Fun:  yummy flat rice noodles with tender pcs of beef, sprouts, onions, and green onions.

5. Chinese broccoli: not on the menu but ask if they have it in stock.  It's sautéed with some garlic and dried fish for an awesome ""sauce"".

1927,725,3.0,"Service was eh. Sucks to say, I'm not much of a seafood person.  Unfortunately for me... That's all this place was. I went with a few of my friends here.

My friend misinformed me and told me there was some other items other than seafood, buuut NOPE. The only other food that wasn't seafood was bread. Luckily, I'm OK with eating some fish, so I got the Parmesan Crusted Halibut, but it honestly wasn't that great to me. I'm sure if I was into oysters, it would've been delicious. My friends raved about the clam chowder from there too.

Speaking for my other friends that love to eat seafood, they loved the oysters. My friend loves this restaurant by the way. The dishes are expensive of course, but what do you expect from Las Vegas. The Calamari was mostly just batter, which was disappointing for my friends. I kind of wanted to try the Lobster Ravioli since it seemed doable for me, but I took a chance with the halibut.  The sauce was called a ""florentine"" sauce or something. Not really my cup of tea, but I didn't have much to choose from.

With summer around the corner, I wanted to cut my hair short... as in real short. I walked right in on a Saturday afternoon and was scheduled for an appt. later that evening. The lady at the front desk told me she would call if an opening came up. Sure enough, within the next 30 mins I received a call and was now ready to try a hairstyle that was new and sassy without being loud.  I wanted a pixie, but wasn't really sure and BG helped me by patiently  walking me through the various choices. We finally decided on one. Not once, during my time there did I feel like I needed to read a magazine. BG made me feel extremely comfortable and surprisingly enough I felt like I could trust her with my hair (remember, this was my 1st time ever here). BG hurt the inside of her palm a few days back and was extremely cautious with how she handled my hair (she even changed her band-aid, just so I felt clean and comfortable). I strongly suggest going here for the following reasons:
- Their staff is extremely friendly, yet professional.
- Trust me, their team KNOWS what they are doing.
- They are economically priced.

360,745,2.0,"This should have been a better experience... 

I'll begin with the food.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.

Then the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the ""lunch menu"" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he'll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us ""Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri"".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn't press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.  

What could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.  Giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention ""that doesn't apply"" until the bill arrives disgraceful.  Deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time, hence the two-stars.",2010-05-10 02:51:20

While trying to sit on or lay in bed I could feel & hear each spring in action. Unbelievable... even when I've stayed at Circus Circus I've gotten much better mattresses with pillow top and nicer decor. The carpeting in the hallways and guest room is very old and needs to get shampooed or replaced.

Cons: menu is confusing and ""building your own combo"" takes a hot minute to figure out. Are we in a Boba place or a milkshake place or a Waffle place? Are we better at breakfast or lunch? Slightly confusing.  Bathroom is dingy, maybe just unkept?, and waffle wasn't hot when served (butter-didn't-melt unhot). Brand feels a little confused somewhere between fast food and mom and pop diner. Fancy waffle around $7-$9 (for just the waffle). Syrup was thin and sweet, not very maple-y, as I had hoped for a waffle place. If you just order a simple waffle with syrup, I think you'd be disappointed. Pros: fruit bowl came with fresh mangos, pineapples and blueberries (amazing fruit bowl). Sandwiches and kids meal come with side/drink. ""Coffee bar"" and hot sauce bar had nice assortment. Most enjoyable was A.J. She greeted us, took our order and was incredibly friendly and informative. She saved our experience, which dependent on the food/cost, wasn't overly impressive.

I got dressed, walked 18min from MGM to the Cosmopolitan and stood in a 25min line (all things I have no problem doing for mouth-watering food) for a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. While I can appreciate the nice staff and their fast service, the sandwich itself was just not what I was expecting. I would say it's a little over-hyped, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I stood in line for 25+ min for a luke warm sandwich on an untoasted/unwarmed brioche bun. The over medium egg was almost room temperature, and the cheese wasn't even melted. I will say, their house-made turkey sausage tasted very good and the honey mustard aioli was a nice touch. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it better if the sandwich was actually served hot--as it should be. Overall I just didn't get the mind blowing experience that I was expecting.

I had the poutine and southern plate, and everything was extremely filling, decadent, and satisfying. It's the opposite of health food. It's treat yoself food. That said, I know they have a few salads, but I feel like it's kinda like how McDonald's has salads... they're there, but nahhhh.

Service was so friendly and genuine. The guys working here seemed like they truly cared about making my first Hogtown visit from across the continent a success. I would love to come back with an even bigger appetite.",2018-05-29 03:08:02

1551,441,3.0,"Friendly service. We went on a Thursday night without reservations and they were able to seat us at the bar right away. The restaurant is a tad small and tight for my taste, and it was very crowded. 

I found the menu to be a bit underwhelming. My friend and I ordered the polenta fries, warm Brie with poached pear, a french onion soup, and a veggie burger- all to share. The polenta fries were tasteless and not at all appetizing. The French onion soup was decent (not the best I've had but not the worst either), the veggie burger was just okay (also kind of bland), but the warm Brie with poached pear was phenomenal and the best part of our meal! 

If it wasn't for the warm Brie then I would say our meal would have been a total bust, but luckily the warm Brie dish redeemed our entire culinary experience at this place. The guy sitting next to me ordered the fish and chips and it looked good, but I would probably not be back.

What I ended up getting isn't actually burnt ends, it's just cubed brisket. There's really no bark, and it appears that it's just thick center-cut brisket. Burnt ends are supposed to come from the tip of the brisket and be smoked longer, resulting in a thick, smoky bark.  What I was served today is NOTHING like what I was served 4 days ago.  I really can't stomach the price when the food is so inconsistent.

And waited.  There was a table of 6 next to us and I was amazed how their order was delivered one burger at a time, about 5 minutes apart.  And we waited.  It took 33 minutes to get 2 regular burgers and 2 drinks. Not even offered our drinks while we waited, no updates on the status of our order.  There were 7 people working around the grill... it was crazy.  I could have gotten a better burger at Red Robin or other restaurants in half the time.  Really too bad, we could use a good cafe on the west side.  

Pros:  Good location
            Staff was reasonably friendly
            Prices were not out of line
            Sizable menu (in fact, probably too large or ambitious)

Cons: Amazingly disorganized kitchen
            No Coke or Dr. Pepper. I was amazed now many people in line  
            asked for both, but got neither.

1228,781,3.0,"Just landed in Vegas and Herringbone was our first stop - was super convenient since we could walk to it from our hotel. It was also Super Bowl Sunday. This review is for the 'ALL YOU CAN EAT, BIG GAME EATS' menu that went on that day. 

For $75 each, we had access to AYCE for the duration of the game. 

Food included:
Unlimited poke bar (with all the extras)
Peel & eat prawns - Mexican white prawns, sambal cocktail sauce
Nachos - chicken, queso, tortilla chips, black beans, tomato salsa, guacamole, scallions
Pigs in a blanket (with house ketchup & mustard)
Wings - pickled cucumber & carrots, chili, cilantro, garlic, peanut sauce
Meatballs - Nana's pork gravy, whipped ricotta, parsley
Bobby's sliders - kobe beef, aged cheddar, grilled onions
Boardwalk fries - old bay, malt vinegar aioli, ketchup, herbs
Mexican street corn - chipotle aioli, scallions, cotija, cilantro

Boyfriend really wanted to see the game and eat, so I went along with his choice of restaurant and the menu had food I was fine with. There was no wait as we walked in and got seated. The atmosphere was loud with tons of guys chattering and drinking. Dozens of flat screen tvs were all over the walls. I guess Vegas has these AYCE buffets specifically during the big game cause it makes the whole event really fun/exciting. There was a deal for drinks going on and since my bf ordered one - he got put into some lottery and the hostesses kept giving him free Jack Daniels stuff lol that was cool I guess. He got some stickers, lip balm, and a necklace.

I liked the idea of the poke bar, and there were tortilla chips too! They had the raw seafood all laid out in the back of the restaurant. The tako (octopus) tasted a lil better than the poke (fish). Poke was mushy and soft - like it wasn't fresh or it was just sitting/marinating in sauce for too long. The shrimps were awesome though. Good size, crunchy, and tasted great dipped with ketchup. I also enjoyed the tomatoes and cucumbers - definitely helped to clear that fishy taste in my mouth in preparation for the rest of food on the menu. 

I did not care for the corn, fries, nor the wings. The corn was covered in a lot of stuff and had waaay too much going on. Expected it to have tons of flavor but it just tasted dry with NO taste. Fries were okay. The wings were too spicy for me. My boyfriend liked the wings the most, and he also ended up eating the rest of the food. 

My favorites were the pigs in a blanket and the sliders for sure. I think I was so hungry that I just really craved meat at the moment and all the other appetizers were not cutting it for me. Pigs in a blanket was nothing special...but it was filling. That's all I wanted. Tasted like regular mini hotdogs with ketchup and mustard. The sliders were AMAZING. Don't know what sauce the patty was covered in, but it was delicious. Wanted to eat more sliders but I couldn't..was too stuffed from just one. #smallstomachproblems 

Wish we didn't order the nachos cause I wasn't expecting them to come in a large bowl. Honestly we just wanted to try a little bit of everything and went crazy ordering. Couldn't finish that along with the meatballs. The meatballs were gooOod, and we ended up taking that and the wings back to the hotel. The nachos were different and not to our liking. They didn't use regular melted cheddar cheese and the chicken was cold while everything else was kind of warm? It just didn't mix well together. I enjoyed a couple first bites of the nachos, but then I got tired of the taste later. 

If we were more hungry, I think the AYCE deal would have been worth it. But my boyfriend and I agreed that for what we paid, we did not get our money's worth. That always seems like the case for these types of situations regarding buffets/AYCE. We just came for the convenience, fast service and the game.... not for the price or food. Probably should have came to Herringbone for their regular breakfast/lunch/dinner hours and maybe then we'd feel like we actually got what we paid for.",2017-02-27 06:22:55

I couldn't understand what happened to the big portion, enough for 2 days and 2 people size lasagna everyone is raving about. I guess Slater thought we wouldn't notice and didn't I tell him we were hungry? (See photo) the description was meat lasagna with meat sauce and there was noting of the sort. I think there was ground sausage and mostly bread crumbs the meat sauce was straight up marinara. As a matter of fact, I thought he brought as the veggie lasagna and verified with Slater that it was in fact their ""Meat"" lasagna. I think they also forgot the lasagna noodles and tried to cover it up with a huge slice of mozzarella that encased the entire 2 inch by 2 inch piece of Lasagna. The deficient piece of lasagna looked more like a large one side ravioli with a huge piece of government cheese on top. The sausage & peppers sandwich was an assemble of 2 pieces of crunchy peppers ( 1 piece red & 1 piece green at one end of the sandwich and caramelized cold onions at the other end. They didn't even bother to throw the 2 in a pan to hear and combine then with the marinara sauce before putting them in the roll. The marinara sauce on the side? Nothing on the bread roll and barely toasted. Did I say I was on a diet?  Atmosphere is clean and fresh smelling.

It was in pretty good condition, almost brand new! For retail, that backpack goes for over $60 or 70. That happened during the 1 out of 6 times I went there. The other times, I ended up empty handed. The main reason for this is due to the fact that the men's clothing and shoe area is extremely small. Out of the entire store, maybe 10% is for guys to look at...

our corner suite was spacious and was about $200-$250 a night. There was 1 bed room, 1 1/2 bathrooms, 1 kitchen, 1 living & room. There no smoking inside the hotel so it smells wonderful!

i loved the full bathroom! it had a shower, bathtub, 2 sinks, and a huge mirror. the shower was all glass so you had the view of the city lights while showering!

wifi was free but the Ethernet cord is much faster!

the other thing I liked was that there were 2 elevators. one for bottom half of floors and the other for the top half. convenient!

i also had dinner at the cafe in the lobby. i recommend the steak wrap!! DELICIOUS!!

167,699,1.0,"Review for: automotive service department.

wow.  what a nightmare.... These people are confidence men. grifters.

I am writing this review as a PUBLIC SERVICE to all people considering going to FORD COUNTRY for automotive service of any kind.  my advice: go somewhere else. ANYWHERE ELSE!  find a dealership in Arizona, or L.A., or Chicago, or wherever.

short story:
Went in for ""free service"" under the FORD recall for a fuel tank part.  Got hustled for an unnecessary inspection fee.

Service department:  They have one job - get you to sign the inspection form, so you will pay for an inspection, whether you need one or not. 

Mike R: service dept representative
-fast-talker, hustler, professional liar  
-his job: ""GET THE SIGNATURE on the intake form""  And he tells a lie or two to make sure you sign it.  (to be fair, there are 5 or 6 people with the same job.)

Mario: service dept. manager
-snowman
-his job: deflection, feeble jedi mind tricks.
-when I called to complain, he gave me the ""gee whiz"" snow job, try to convince me they did nothing wrong.  he threw in a few other tactics, for good measure, and ended with an explanation that i didn't remember the incident correctly.  snow job complete.

Its clear that the entire company supports the hustle.  They were not at all surprised by my accusations.  If they were, I would already have my refund.  Thats what GOOD BUSINESSES DO.

This is not a 'GOOD BUSINESS' for consumers. They are a blight upon the Henderson business community.  STEER CLEAR.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
long version:

FACT:  I went into the dealership service dept after my car failed smog; wanted to see if the smog fail could have been caused by the gas tank recall issue.
FACT:  I talked with MIKE ROBINSON and asked to have my car checked for recall issues. (this FREE OF CHARGE under FORD recall policy.)
FACT:  Mike asks, ""are there any other issues?"". me: ""yeah, sure. theres a check-engine light on.  i'd like to see if its related to the recall."" (a brief internet search indicated that the 'check-engine' light is common in the case of the fuel tank recall issue.)
FACT: M.R. presents the work order for signature.  price $150.  WHAT? i thought this is covered under the recall. M.R. : ""oh, sure! thats only if the check-engine light is caused by something else."" Me: O.K.  I'm certain the recall thing will solve the problem.
FACT:  2 hours later: car was serviced for recall.  M.R. calls and said, ""yeah, we found another part that we are RECOMMENDING for replacement.  we can take care of that for $700.  if not, it'll be $129.95 for just the inspection.""

BINGO!!! Theres the hustle.  1) lie to my face, 2) find a ""part recommended for replacement, and 3) charge the inspection fee, as you had planned from the start. 

**IMPORTANT POINT**:  just to be crystal clear, the 'other part' was ""recommended for replacement.""  This part was not in failure.  This part DID NOT CAUSE the check-engine light. (both facts were confirmed in a conversation with service department manager.)

**IMPORTANT POINT**:  The day I took the car from FC, and after the recalled fuel tank part was replaced, the check-engine light went off.  The car passed smog test two days later.

The 'Customer Service' odyssey:
After trying to get a refund, I realized I'm more likely to get a chicken leg away from the mouth of a stray dog.  It is apparent that if a customer is unhappy and would like a refund, that is just NEVER going to happen.

I spent three weeks speaking with any of three wonderful people, NONE OF WHOM were authorized to give me a refund of any kind.  When I finally spoke with someone who COULD give me a refund (Mario), he gave me the final stone wall.  That conversation was brief, rude, and offensive.  After a few other tactics, he said,""No, you weren't in for recall service, you were here for a check-engine light.""  The final insult:  full-on gaslighting me.  ugh
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
IN THE END, All you need to know is this:  

1.  Representatives in the SERVICE DEPARTMENT get COMMISSION on repairs. (this fact obtained by FC employees.)
2.  'ford country' has a full-time staff devoted to fielding customer complaints.  FULL TIME! (o.k., actually 2 or 3 women, each working part time.)  I wish these ladies well; they are taking all the heat for FORD COUNTRY's business practices.  One of them (M.M.) did a great job, was really nice, and somewhat sympathetic.  best of luck M.M.

The icing on the cake:  In the repair department, there are signs on the desk begging people to leave ""good reviews"" on yelp....

HERE IS A HOT TIP FOR THE PEOPLE AT FORD COUNTRY:  If you want ""good reviews,""  you might try giving people a square deal.",2017-12-05 23:09:10

1113,181,1.0,"This dump does not even deserve 1 star! I was looking forward to my second visit to Chipotle in my life and it happened to appear like a message from God after a long walk on the strip. The workers on the ""burrito"" line were great...except for the last two. One girl wrapped up your burrito in foil and the other wrote on them and prepared them for the cashier. The girl wrapping the burritos seemed like a robot and therefore didn't notice that every piece of pre-cut foil was a little too small to wrap the full burrito. This left a small 1/2 inch by 2 inch exposed area on the burrito. That's OK (I thought) as she finished wrapping, but then the retard flipped the burritio upside down and the next employee in line just slid the burrito down the counter to the cashier! SOOOO GROSS. You could tell they had a ""rhythm"" going as it was busy (as I'm sure it always is since it's on the strip). So once I told her there was no way in hell i was eating a burrito that had been slid on a counter all the way to the cashier, she seemed upset but ordered another burrito to be made right away. Then, I get to the cashier and order myself a Corona with my burrito. Corona pops on the counter but with a disgusting lime. It wasn't even a faint shade of green, it was brown and way squishy. Almost the consistency of playdoh. I'm not about to drink herpes in a bottle so I explained that the lime was near compost quality and the same lady that I complained about the burrito to went fishing in the lime bin. She came out with another lime that had a brown bruise on the skin and said ""They all look like that"" and I took it, because I am well aware of the bruising habits of limes in particular since Coronas are like water in my life. I could have debated on the difference between the first lime I received and the second, but I was hungry and really needed to start chugging the beer after my experience. Sorry for the INCONVENIENCE CHIPOTLE. I surely slowed down your process on that nice Saturday afternoon on the strip but why don't you serve SANITARY food. As far as I'm concerned, you should be shut down for health violations, but I am sure you won't be because most of the people ingesting your food are drunk and/or nasty and probably already have HIV.",2010-11-23 17:09:04

875,527,4.0,"This breakfast/brunch joint is the hidden gem you hope to find when you want to escape from the generic boring IHOP'S and Dennys' of the world. I love restaurants that get creative with their menus! This place gives you plenty of options and offers a unique variety that will leave you so indecisive, you have to come back again to try something else! They also have daily specials that aren't on the regular menu and they are just as tempting when you aren't sure what you're in the mood for. 
I tried the fried bologna sandwich because it is something I've never had in my life. It was good, the sandwich was big, the grilled onions give it extra flavor and there's plenty of meat.  I don't know if I'd order it again, only because I'm not used to eating bologna when it's hot and it's not something I'd eat often, but there were plenty of other things I want to try in the future. 
I chose potato salad to go with my sandwich,  the tricky thing about potato salad is if you're making it while the potatoes are still hot,  you're going to get a funky taste once you add the dressing to it. It was okay,  but it was even better when I added California 3 pepper hot sauce to it. That hot sauce is magical! I'm going to buy a bottle or 2 when I go back. I wish I could buy a case, I have a feeling they will make an excellent sauce for hot wings!  They sell the bottles up in the front and there are 3 different kinds to choose from. They also have baked goods, I didn't try them yet,  but they looked good- nice and big in size. Prices are fair and comparable to other breakfast places, but I can tell you the flavor and quality rises waaay above the generic ""blah"" of soggy undercooked hash browns from the likes of Denny's. The waitress and manager were friendly and welcoming.

At 7:00 I decided to check and see how much longer and was told that my party was already seated. I informed the little hostess that we were not, we were all outside, and she blankly stared at me in disbelief. I asked how much longer and she said probably another 25 minutes. They had my name written down along with what shirt I was wearing and I at no point saw another women with a blue striped tank top arrive with a party of 6 so I demanded to see the manager.

927,65,5.0,"I have been frequenting Bookmans both in Phoenix and Flagstaff for several years now, and I left a review this past January that was critical of several aspects of the business. I felt the need at this point to reassess my review here, because my experience with the Bookmans in West Phoenix as of late has been dichotomously different than before. 

Their selection of books, especially quantum physics and religion/spirituality subjects, is heavily refreshed from when it was just recycled authors and topic matter for a while. Also, the knick-knack section, which for a while was stale with the same old product, is now so full with many new ones that random shelves all over the store are adorned with the overflow. Granted, I have noticed the price of those knick-knacks, especially the ones with the Asian motif(s) increasing in price lately, but one is still more than able to find something little and neat within a good price range should one look hard enough. 

Finally, the attitudes and demeanors of the staff there, at least the ones I have had the pleasure to interact with lately, are all very pleasant and positive, and very very helpful. Just today, I was helped above and beyond by several employees regarding locating and purchasing a few books that even on my very limited budget currently, are necessary for my research and authorship. In no way am I taking back my previous review, but I am definitely impressed with, and won over by the Bookmans experiences I have had recently, and just wanted to say thank you to them for their help and customer service, and for providing a place near my home where I can go and get lost for a few in a wonderful way--whether I buy a basketful of books, or just am perusing all the ones I would one day like to afford:-).",2013-08-31 05:13:06

736,117,5.0,"""Death by All You Can Order Brunch""

On our search for a good Sunday brunch on the Las Vegas strip, my husband and I came across Border Grill on Yelp.  We have been to Border Grill in Santa Monica for happy hour, and really enjoyed the tacos we ate there, but when we saw the brunch menu here, we were sold.  You see, my husband is a huge fan of anything ""all you can eat"", but I don't love buffets because the food is often mediocre and the thought of people digging through the same food kind of skeeves me out.  Border Grill serves an ""all you can eat"" brunch for $34.99 per person, but you actually order small plates off a menu.  The best of both worlds for us, especially when for an additional $8, you can add bottomless mimosas!

We made a reservation via Open Table for 11am, and were sat at a great table on the patio overlooking the pool area at Mandalay Bay.  We started off ordering 2 dishes each, and subsequently 1 dish each thereafter.  We never felt rushed by our server, which was a pleasant surprise.  Before our first dishes came, we were brought some delicious flaky empanadas, and the best corn tamales I've ever had (not being a fan of tamales, this was a great surprise)!  The mimosas were great, generous on the champagne, and there were many flavors to sample.  We had the typical orange juice mimosas, as well as peach, pomegranate, and my favorite, cucumber lemon.  Here is a list of the items we sampled, in the order we ate them, and our assessment:

Breakfast Enchilada- good, but the corn tortilla was hard to cut
Shrimp and Grits- DELICIOUS, shrimp were cooked perfectly
Skirt Steak and Eggs- best thing on the menu.  The steak was perfectly medium rare and well seasoned
Short Rib Hash and Egg- average

Crispy Potato Rajas Taco- crispy and yummy
Biscuits and Sausage Gravy- gravy was delish but 1 biscuit would have been plenty

Breakfast Fries- smothered french fries, so delicious and bad for you, in a good way
Bacon Jalapeno PBJ- a unique blending of flavors, but I didn't love it as much as I thought I would

Lobster Pancake- I enjoyed this, my husband did not like
Waffle with Pork Belly and Syrup- a wonderful blend of sweet and savory

Skirt Steak and Eggs- SO GOOD WE ORDERED IT AGAIN BUT CAN'T FINISH IT
Bread Pudding French Toast- decadent and delicious, but I'm starting to feel like there's a brick in my stomach

Churro Tots- oh dear God we ordered too much and I feel like I might die

The food was so delicious we could not stop eating until we literally felt like we were going to explode.  It was all so amazing and delicious.  I don't regret our gluttonous brunch whatsoever because the food was just that yummy.  Suffice it to say we wobbled back to our hotel, took a food/champagne nap, and didn't eat much of anything for the rest of the day.

801,123,5.0,"I only knew this was the best salon when I was lured away by a chichi North Scottsdale salon that had all the bells and whistles, except my almost-to-the-length-I-wanted hair and nearly shoulder-length bangs now became an homage to Jennifer Anniston (circa Friends do). I wanted to speed to SnapDragon and beg their forgiveness for cheating. 

Flash forward a few months and my thick, ethnic, wavy (just plain difficult) hair grew back enough to be ready for a fix. Sure enough, Michaela worked her magic. The layers are blended and virtually disappear into one another rather than remaining like a tiered cake.

Yes, their prices are a bit higher than other salons, but you get what you pay for. What is a few extra dollars spread out over a few months? I'll skip a Starbucks or two to have my hair looking nice every day for months!!!

ONLY other drawback is limited parking.

I echo many other reviews; owner Kandi (sp?) and Jenny are amazing with cut and color in every circumstance. Both perfectionists and always speaking the truth; if they don't think your hair is the type that will hold that color or be right for that cut, they'll tell you! I've overheard them talk to a client who wanted their jet black hair to be a blonde ombré (immediately) and a frizzy, curly girl to have a straight bob.

It is very noisy (we were there on a Friday night so it may be better on other nights), and we had to wait 50 minutes for a table.  The bar scene is lively but, again, very noisy - you shout to be heard by the person standing in front of you.  The selection of beers is great, and they have a full bar.  My wife and I were with a group of friends making a total of 8.  Fortunately, we were given a table on the patio outside the restaurant.  This was a godsend because it was cool, calm, peaceful, with stars over our heads.  The food was very good and served in Italian restaurant portions: BIG.  My wife's coconut shrimp was somewhat overdone.  My linguine with meatballs was very good. The salads were generous and fresh.  Our waiter was very congenial and efficient.

I liked everything so much I went back the next day.  I had banana walnut pancakes, which were much more like cake than pancakes (for me as a US person).  They were scrumptious but so filling that by the time I ate the generous serving of fruit, I could only finish one pancake.

If you're visiting, I'd really go to this location as the other one is very small and the service is less good if you're English speaking.  Also, it's right in the pedestrian zone and across from the art museum.  Fabulous.",2015-08-30 16:32:15

Amenities before the gate are limited in Terminal 1, a Subway, Tim Hortons ,  Wolfgang Puck, and Swiss Chalet.  Inside security both USA and Canada are limited as well, with restaurants and shopping being limited in their choice.   The security is sloppy, unorganized, and slow with huge line ups and rude officers, and employees.  Come early for your flights, this isn't a very efficient airport, there seems to be a lot of loitering airport employees and CATSA employees getting coffee, playing on cell phones, shopping in the shops.  Any questions from the public is met with an aggressive, negative, over compensation, by employees to passengers, so swallow your contempt, and move on!   The best advice I can give, come early so you aren't tempted to lose your cool, or question anything.  The reason for the high cost of fees on your ticket is quickly apparent, as soon as you enter the airport,  so close your eyes! Good Luck and Welcome to Toronto.",2014-06-28 11:46:26

My husband got the 4 Piece Honey Dipped Fried Chicken Dinner with Baked Beans and Potato Salad as sides. The chicken was crispy even after the honey dip. The baked beans were smoky and the potato salad had a nice hint of mustard. The chicken was quite good for a slightly sweeter version of fried chicken. I got the Meatball Parmigiana Sub with the Criss Cut Fries. The sandwich was tasty. I was pretty pleased with it. The fries were soggy, but I didn't expect them to be perfect since they were delivered to me. Despite them being soggy, they were still good. For dessert, we decided to try something that we both enjoy and then two separate items. We enjoyed the crunch of the fresh Cannoli with the smooth and silky filling. My husband's tiramisu was good, but a bit on the dry side. My chocolate mousse pie was light and fluffy. It was a little dry for my liking, but it was still good.

1867,699,1.0,"Had a appointment this morning with my mother who's 2015 Ford Focus was issued in for a recall.  When we first arrived we initially waited approximately 5 minutes to be greeted by Justin a (African American Male) who works in the service department.  He continued to ask if we had a appointment as we did at 8am and was then able to find us in his system. He asked what we were in for so we explained we came in for the transmission.  He told us that was not covered under the recall but something else with the computer system was. My mom and I having questions asked about the transmission before being interrupted by Justin who said: ""if we would let him finish he would explain.""  He again talked about the recall and left all transmission questions unanswered. Finally we came to terms that the recall malfunctioning might be able to solve all transmission issues which still didn't quite make sense but we continued to proceed anyway. We asked about getting our rental car and Justin told us we were not covered even though my mom had paper work stating we were. He continued to show no interest in trying to help us so I said: ""this is bullshit let's go."" Justin said I was cussing and asked me to leave. Which we proceeded out the door. Upon leaving we ran into a nice younger Latina lady who I didn't get her name who then took us to the finance department. We were introduced to another middle aged white gentleman who again I did not get his name who was able to look and see that we in fact were covered for a rental car. After spending almost a half hour with him we were directed back to the service department with a 1-800 number for them to call and verify the rental coverage. Upon returning the service department a worker there refused to call the number or give us a rental until they knew what was wrong with the car. Which would of taken them a day and a half to diagnose leaving my mother and I without any vehicle. I informed them that we just spoke to the financial department who told us differently. At that time the service manager stepped in and began helping us who again I did not get his name (older white gentleman).  He assured us he would take care of us and apologized for the inconveniences. We were then taken back to the service department and helped by another employee there. While in the process of wrapping things up Justin stepped back into the service department with a huge grin on his face and began singing idiots, idiots, idiots there so stupid. My mom began to cry and told the employee she felt mistreated, upset from the loss of her husband and just wanted her car fixed. I being her son got upset back and sung my own little song asshole, asshole, asshole. Justin immediately took defense confronting us in our face and said that his stupid song was not directed towards us. (Even tho no one was in the room) maybe he had a imaginary friend he was singing to? You could feel the discomfort  even from the emoloyee who was helping us. Justin obviously directed his idiot song towards my mother and I. Seems he was upset that we were being taken care of afterall. At that time we stopped all conversation and just wanted our car. My mother said to Justin to please leave us be with the gentleman who was already helping us. That wasnt good enough Justin left and then came back in with the service manager who then asked us to leave. I asked why but was given no explanation.  I told him Justin had been taunting us from the beginning and even took it as far as calling us idiots.  I feel sorry for anyone who comes in contact with this guy. My mother who just moved here to Vegas after the passing of her husband just wanted her car fixed but instead we ended up in this situation.

1005,88,4.0,"When in Vegas you do things that you do not say and the things your friends shall not repeat!  

So lets say you are at a convention and having drinks when one of the guys tells you he has a cabana reserved at a nightclub called Surrender?  You look around and notice you are 10 guys, but you shrug your shoulders and hop in a limo to the Encore Hotel.

You then get there and find Bobby.  You tell Bobby that you reserved a cabana , give him a credit card and get your ID out to prove that you are twice the age limit which means you will be twice as fun.  The guy looks at you but does not think it is funny!  But as you whiz past the club hopefuls, you take note of everyone in the harsh lighting as you don't want to regret things later. As you enter the club they brand you with the ""over 40"" stamp and walk past the inside club which is dark and out into the shallow pool area which in the dream that I had is littered with young sirens in short dresses on lily pad like tables. It is a stadium-like atmosphere with tables and loungers around the pool and 2 floors of cabanas along the rim. For your money you will be happy to be outside with the big money players who are hoping to get played or to play you.  Fortunately this is only a dream and doesn't happen in real life. 

You get escorted to your cabana and your exotic cabana beauty named Shelley who is made up of what seems like 10 different ethnic backgrounds squeezed into a size zero dress  and 5 inch heels starts pouring drinks.  Remember that you are with 10 guys and the testosterone levels are raging.  Fortunately for Shelley there are scantily clad women lounging all around the cabana waiting for you to invite them over to drink your booze.  You watch as your friends somehow convince them to enter your den of wolves and look foolish.  Remember,  you took mental photos outside.  

Suddenly, like the movies, everything turns to slo-mo as cool people enter the cabana next door and start displaying the cool dance moves you once had before you had that accident where you damaged both your knees trying to ascend Everest for the 100th time.  The women look amazing and one of the guys invites you over and introduces himself.  He knows you are a baller as you shelled out dough to attract cabana babes.  He looks over your 10 homies and asks where the girls are.  You lie and tell him you are celebrating ""Ethan's Freedom and Divorce"".  You find out your new friend is from another club and he and ""his girls"" are VIP hosts and hostesses. And now the females come and introduce themselves and tell you they'd like to see you at their club!  They take some selfies with you and now you see your buddies gazing over.  The myth has now begun and you are a Vegas God for future stories. Lol!

The rest of the night is a blur.  You wake in the morning alone with no chickens or tigers in your room and a full set of teeth. You do have a stamp on your hand and a mouth full of cotton balls though.  Yep, it didn't happen like that.  Those pictures on your phone are fake.  It never happened and nobody will ever know.",2014-10-09 20:23:32

There are many creative styles of cocktails to choose from.  We experienced the Thai Down - which had tequilla, chilli syrup, strawberries, thai basil and ginger (if you like your drinks rimmed, suggestion is to ask for the rim of the glass dipped in the chilli syrup and then dipped in sugar).  I also tried the Kaffir the Reaper - which had coconut vodka, Chinese five-spice, yuzu sour, coconut-ginger tea and ginger beer, garnished with a Kaffir lime leaf, this drink had a very unique taste, slightly soft and almost reminiscent of an adult more sophisticated Shirley Temple.  We didn't get a chance to explore the two other levels of the bar, but I've heard in the middle level is where patrons can request a secret drink not on the menu, the Verbena, which is supposed to be a whole experience in itself.

The cheese that came with the dippers was phenomenal, and we saved the leftovers for our fries later on during our mean! The wings were amazing but were definitely spicy.

We had the Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger, which was also a delicious option. We shared the brisket sandwich, which I didn't try, but my boyfriend said it was amazing but had a bit too much sauce.

Visits: one, lunch

Breads - They give you a basket with a couple different types of bread. Nice! Something for everyone. The best of the bunch was the jalapeno cheese bread. LOVED it. Cornbread really was very crumbly, and it was also slightly salty, which was odd. I like my cornbread sweet, thanks.

Blue Corn Pancake - Eh. Thought the sauce was a little weird....

Tiger Prawn Tamale - Oh man was that delicious. And the corn was so yummy, but it's really filling so be careful with that one as an appetizer.

Sophie's salad - Great! I love fruity dressings and cheese.

Crab pancakes - You certainly do get a lot of crab, but I wasn't wowed by it. Very filling.

Pork tenderloin - I don't know if it was supposed to be cold, but I don't like my meat cold unless it is sandwich ""meat"". Had an interesting flavor, but eh.

Cuban burger - SOOOOO GOOOOOOOD. I don't even like mustard (I told the waiter no dijon, and he said that was the one thing they couldn't take out...) but man was that burger good. I didn't even really taste the dijon.

Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash - Okay, so I don't know if it's just me, but when I see ""hash"" I think like hash browns or maybe some sort of sweet potato fries... What we got was more like ""mash,"" and it was actually mixed in with the chicken.  Kind of gross in my opinion.  Really sweet, not spicy at all.

Coconut layer cake - TO DIE FOR. So moist and delicious. And you get a gigantic slice. Enough for two or more people depending on how full you are.

Chocolate creme brulee with blueberry compote - OMNOMNOMNOM.  The chocolate at the bottom of the creme brulee really makes it even better.",2010-08-30 06:11:12

The room was horrible - no blackout curtains on North wall that let light through around the shade (had to prop 5 pillows on one side of the bed to stop light from hitting me in the face), the carpet was stained, there were only 5 hangers, no fridge (knew that ahead of time), the ""pillow-top"" bed is hard as a rock, and the room temperature can never get comfortable because the controls are near the door and the ac/heat is near the window - by the time the cold reaches the thermostat, it's freezing in the middle of the room where the bed is!

Lastly, the door lock is tricky (Room 21213) and doesn't always read the card right. Had to try 5 times or more to get the card to read (and I was sticking it in correctly).

And that was just the room!

The shuttles let you off clear on the other side of the registration - and you have to go down steps with your luggage to get from one end to another. Check-in takes forever. The other vacationers are loud, obnoxious, and rude. Security never smiles and it seems like everyone is drunk. The kids run around screaming their heads off and parents don't give a damn.

I would have been more comfortable in a tent at the campground on the hard floor with the bugs eating me alive.",2015-02-02 13:24:16
1646,474,1.0,"Bought a Dodge Challenger at Towbin Dodge in 2014 and was pressed beyond belief to buy an extended warranty for $2,000 by their obnoxiously pushy finance guy.  He also pressed me to buy the gap coverage and a tire / rim warranty.  
I sold this vehicle recently to Carmax (great experience by the way!).  After looking at my paperwork, the helpful person at Carmax informed me that I was entitled to pro-rated rebates on all of these items I'd purchased from Towbin Dodge.
I went back to Towbin Dodge with all of the paperwork I was given when I bought the car from them and asked their finance dept. to process these refunds.  They quickly picked thru my paperwork and said they'd process the gap and wheel warranty refund but they advised me they couldn't help me with the general warranty because I didn't have my actual policy.  I explained this was ALL the paperwork I was given when I bought the car from them.  I've never removed a single paper from the paperwork they gave me and never had any reason to look through it until now.
I asked nicely and repeatedly for them to help me.  I said, ""surely you guys must be able to get me a copy of the policy you sold me for $2,000"".  The finance guy repeatedly said, ""nope, sorry guy - can't help you.""  I said over and over, ""can't you at least give me the number for the company so I can get it myself""?  Again, he was completely unhelpful and rude and kept saying no as he walked away.  
Thinking quickly, I went into their service department and thought maybe if I trick them into thinking they can get some work out of me, then they might be willing to help me, so I walked up there and showed the guy a copy of my sales contract from 2 years ago.  I showed him the line item for $2,000 that showed I was charged $2,000 by Towbin Dodge for a warranty policy from First Automotive.  I told the guy I needed to get some warranty work done but I misplaced First Automotive's phone number and he then quickly and gladly gave it to me.
I called First Automotive and explained that I sold the car and asked what I needed to do get a refund on my warranty.  They said to email them that I was cancelling the policy along with a copy of my odometer disclosure and bill of sale to prove that I sold the car, which I did.
After about a month, I called First Automotive back to check on the status of my refund.  They were unable to find any record of me or my warranty that Towbin Dodge supposedly ordered with my $2,000.  Maybe that's why the Towbin Dodge finance guy practically ran away when I asked him to help me with a warranty refund.  Maybe they never ordered it and someone pocketed my money?
Maybe they'll be a little nicer and more forthcoming in producing my warranty for the Judge when I file suit.",2016-07-02 00:10:42

1579,801,1.0,"Just got a take out order from here and was thoroughly  shocked as to how this place has good reviews. First off we called in our order and was confused as to how a pizza place only has one size pizza?! Whatever it's only two of us and not a big deal, but then the lady on the phone says it will be done in 5 minutes?! This is where the red flags start flying. I don't understand how it's fresh made to order in 5 minutes, but whatever we will give it a chance. So we get there 6 minutes after we called, and there is our pizza just on the counter already in a box with nothing keeping it warm. Still we think let's just try it. So we open the box and we are met with one of the greasiest pizzas I have ever seen. I picked up a slice and all of the toppings just slipped off and revealed a nice underdone crust. Still I took a bite and was overwhelmed by the amount of basil and a very generic sauce with really no flavor. I don't know how this place can call itself a pizzeria and serve me this disgrace.",2016-12-18 04:18:17
256,413,3.0,"Food: Overall, the food is tasty, but the some of the items are overcooked or dry. An example meat that was overcooked was the Korean dry ribs. The nice thing about water is that they had a nice glass water bottle on the table for you to use and refill your glass at your own leisure.  I would have liked more food with the plastic syringe containing a syrup or sauce, but that's because I like fun food. :) There were only two that had them. The small cheese platter was delectable. I love how the food was small and cutely presented. The stirfry vegetables (Asian) was very chewy and overcooked. They should have pruned the vegetables, leaving the parts that were still fresh and cut them into more bite sized pieces. Yes, you can cut it, but it was so chewy that cutting it with the provided knife was not useful. I also loved the gelato section. I got the Thai tea gelato and it tasted heavenly. The deep fried tofu was so dry but the peanut sauce was yummy. My three favorite dishes were the bacon and tomato salad with candied bacon, the strawberry shortcake, and the best one, the crostini with grilled peach on top (DELICIOUS). I  ended up eating a lot because I was trying all sorts of things, but it was a fun experience. The best food is at the dessert and cold food sections for me.

Atmosphere: This place is beautifully decorated with a modern feel. It is located at the Cosmopolitan which has a modern interior too. We had dinner there on Wednesday night, so there was no line. Since there wasn't a lot of people there, we had a nice quiet dinner.

Service: For a place that charges me more than $30 a person ($34.99 to be exact for a Wednesday night), I expect the service to be more attentive/quick. Our table for two did not have room for the plates we were actively eating plus the plates we were finished using. I expected them to sweep in and remove the plates. They were rather slow and took their time doing so.

Bottom line: I give this buffet a 3.5 but am rounding down to 3 after having gone to the Bacchanal Buffet. :) You are welcome to check out my review of the Bacchanal Buffet on yelp too.",2012-09-20 15:27:36
24,701,1.0,"This place is gross. Besides that, it's a good gym.

There are some positives of this Planet Fitness. The equipment seemed in good repair. Members here wipe equipment after use and there were plenty of paper towel rolls and bottles of cleaner to do so. This Planet Fitness has a hair dryer in the women's locker room, which is nice. There is ample parking and the employees are pleasant, too. 

The main negative of this Planet Fitness is the ick factor. Not only is it obviously not cleaned regularly, it does not appear to be cleaned EVER. There was multicolored scuz on and around the water fountain mouthpiece and it had obviously not even been wiped off - much less sanitized - any time in the recent past (see photos). I later mentioned this to an employee who was pushing around a cart with bottles of cleaner. Figuring she was maybe cleaning, I described to her what I saw and asked if there was a rag I could use to clean the water fountain myself. She told me she would take a look at it. 

Not only did the employee with the cleaning supply cart never look at the water fountain (despite going around it several times), none of the other four employees did, either. Instead, they all stayed behind the front counter talking with each other and greeting members who came in (which occurred about once every fifteen minutes and could have been handled by a single employee). 

Two hours after mentioning the biohazard of a water fountain, it had still not been looked at or cleaned...but the front counter was well weighted down. 

The showers (see photos), changing areas, floors, water fountains, counters, and door knobs at this Planet Fitness are petri dishes. A solution to this issue may be to implement a procedure for employees to clean and sanitize throughout their shifts, especially when it is well staffed and not busy.",2017-12-21 01:01:36

We expected slow service on this visit because it was a Holiday weekend.

He went back to the kitchen and advised us that our food would be out in five minutes. After waiting another 10 to 15 minutes, the food finally came out one meal short. We were offered no apology or discount for the forgotten meal and slow service. Nothing on our ticket was comped.

54,51,4.0,"We had a great stay at the Platinum.  I had no qualms at staying at a non-gaming (read: not a casino) hotel off the Strip.  It's a quick walk to all the action (about 5 to 10 minutes to the Flamingo depending on how quick you pound the pavement).  

The suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.

Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.

I never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).

The restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times), but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu, signature cocktails, wines by the glass, bottles that are sold by the glass, and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day, all night. 

We frequented the happy hour several times during our trip, and we were stoked every visit.

1470,778,4.0,"Who goes into a coffee house and orders a dessert in the morning? I do. Well, I did go there for a waffle, but it comes with a scoop of ice cream and a whole lot of sweetness. During the time of the review, I don't think they're done with their displays yet, because there's a dessert stand in the front that hasn't been filled and they're still adding pictures of their creations into the Ipad that can be viewed in the front. I wish they were in a much better plaza, because this place is lodged in the corner of the plaza and there's no other place that is popular enough to make you wonder how good this place is.

The ambiance of the location definitely gives visitors an opportunity to study while you're here. They play Asian music, but instead of the usual K-pop heavy bass music that's played at other tea places, this one will provide very relaxing tunes to give it more of a Starbucks vibe. The employees are definitely nice, but I think they also found it funny that I ordered something with ice cream to start my morning. There's also outdoor seating.

Once settled down, I whipped out my laptop, and to compliment the waffle, I ordered a caramel macchiato. How was it? The waffle was great. It's nicely decorated and scattered with nuts to add onto it. The coffee had a nice strong taste to it and it wasn't full of caramel taste. It's enough to wake you up and ready to start your day. Overall, I really like this place a lot and I hope their business starts to increase because of it. It's what Southwest Vegas needs; small upcoming businesses that are hoping to thrive in the future. I really don't want to see more Starbucks popping up, but I guess that's kind of inevitable right?

53,523,2.0,"First the review of the restaurant:
  I would actually have given the restaurant 4 stars, but since this is a combined review of the restaurant & club, and the club I will give zero stars, that averages out to a 2.  
  The food was delicious.  No complaints about that.  The garlic bread to begin with was great.  Their caprese salad had great fresh mozzarella which I love.  I have to say their flat bread pizza was just ok, nothing special, but it's the cheapest thing on the menu and definitely filling.  We ordered a pitcher of white sangria, which was good, but kinda expensive ($70/pitcher).  Overall everything about LAVO the restaurant was nice including the decor, the service & the food.

Now the review of the club:
  Worst club I've ever seen in Vegas!  We went here for free after eating at the LAVO restaurant.  It was about 11:30pm when we got into the club.  YUCK!!!  First of all it was TINY!!  Seriously, the smallest club I've EVER seen.  And then it was SUPER packed with really gross people I might add.  It was almost impossible to dance on the dance floor and we didn't even try getting a drink.  The bar was insane.  We spent 5 minutes here and then I couldn't stand it anymore!  Awful place, I hope you will avoid it after reading my review.  Go to XS or Marquee!!!!  After leaving LAVO (this was on a Sunday night), we asked one of the female employees at the exit where she would suggest going, and she said XS.",2012-06-26 00:18:17

791,866,2.0,"I'm not a huge fan.

I don't gamble and so this review is not for the casino. I am reviewing this as a Doubletree hotel.

I came to Vegas for a conference, and decided to stay at a Hilton property.  If you are in that boat, and just want a nice Hilton hotel, I would not stay here.

It smells terrible.  When you first walk in the front doors, you are affronted by (a) smoke, and (b) something that smells like womens' perfume being used to cover said smoke.

The casino is really, really sad.  Lots and lots of elderly people addicted to gaming. At other casinos on the strip I saw lots of young folks -- definitely not here.  Average age probably about 60, and it just felt terrible to see so many fixed incomes going down the drain.

I got a room back in the secondary tower (they have 2).  It was a good 10 minute walk from the main entrance. Which was annoying, because they didn't have any sort of exit to the street from that tower -- they make you walk all the way back through the smelly casino just to get out.

Unfortunately like a number of Doubletrees (unlike the lower-priced Hamptons, ironically), the A/C doesn't allow the fan to be forced on.  I like to leave a fan running as background noise to help me sleep.  There was a fan in the bathroom that was perfect for this, but it also was configured to be force-connected to the light switch.  Evil.

Restaurants were so-so, and expensive. There is a Starbucks onsite, which is worth a second star.  The other restaurants weren't anything to write home about.

My friend was visiting from out of town and I am a local but I don't mind going to places on the strip if it is worth it. This place is not. The music was loud and the show of dancing guys on stilts making animal balloons did not impress me. My friend got the island pork wrap and said it was ok but not worth coming back for.

Only gripe with this is that when it gets super packed (after 11-11:30PM ish) it is so hard to move around on the dance floor.  It will take you at least 10+ minutes to navigate through the damn thing.  Also, the walkways into the pool area were kind of hard to navigate too because people would just chill there or take pictures, since finding a place to sit down other then around the pool is going to COST you [i.e. Table]

We got in around 10PMish and it was pretty nice, not too packed, bartenders are super chill and nice.  The blackjack tables were a nice touch/offers you more to do, but I wouldn't recommend it though, haha.

24,701,1.0,"This place is gross. Besides that, it's a good gym.

There are some positives of this Planet Fitness. The equipment seemed in good repair. Members here wipe equipment after use and there were plenty of paper towel rolls and bottles of cleaner to do so. This Planet Fitness has a hair dryer in the women's locker room, which is nice. There is ample parking and the employees are pleasant, too. 

The main negative of this Planet Fitness is the ick factor. Not only is it obviously not cleaned regularly, it does not appear to be cleaned EVER. There was multicolored scuz on and around the water fountain mouthpiece and it had obviously not even been wiped off - much less sanitized - any time in the recent past (see photos). I later mentioned this to an employee who was pushing around a cart with bottles of cleaner. Figuring she was maybe cleaning, I described to her what I saw and asked if there was a rag I could use to clean the water fountain myself. She told me she would take a look at it. 

Not only did the employee with the cleaning supply cart never look at the water fountain (despite going around it several times), none of the other four employees did, either. Instead, they all stayed behind the front counter talking with each other and greeting members who came in (which occurred about once every fifteen minutes and could have been handled by a single employee). 

Two hours after mentioning the biohazard of a water fountain, it had still not been looked at or cleaned...but the front counter was well weighted down. 

The showers (see photos), changing areas, floors, water fountains, counters, and door knobs at this Planet Fitness are petri dishes. A solution to this issue may be to implement a procedure for employees to clean and sanitize throughout their shifts, especially when it is well staffed and not busy.",2017-12-21 01:01:36

What I ended up getting isn't actually burnt ends, it's just cubed brisket. There's really no bark, and it appears that it's just thick center-cut brisket. Burnt ends are supposed to come from the tip of the brisket and be smoked longer, resulting in a thick, smoky bark.  What I was served today is NOTHING like what I was served 4 days ago.

The atmosphere was very fun, the service was good, and the experience was excellent.  We've been to similar places out in LA & Angry Crab beat them hands down.  We loved the shrimp, king crab legs, & mussels.  Can't wait to go again & try out the crawfish, too.  We got our bags with sausage, corn, & potatoes...get all three, they're excellent cheap additions.  The sauces were great & the spice levels were solid (we only went as high as 2/med & it was yummy - a proper medium, not a wimpy medium).  The garlic was good, but the trifecta was slightly better.

I would advise new diners to stick to the boiled bags.  We also tried the chicken fingers, gator nuggets, calamari, and fries.  The only fried food that was above average was the calamari, which was actually quite good.

Expect a wait on the weekend, but it's absolutely worth the wait & they roll out the food pretty fast.  The prices are not cheap, but very reasonable for the quality/freshness of the seafood.

Good service - Check! I came with a few girlfriends and my sister and decided since it was an outing for my birthday that I would pick up the tab. The hostess helped me with my sneaky task by taking my credit card information before I sat down. My friends were a little upset that they couldn't pay for dinner, but I guess they can get me back on their birthdays!

Ambiance - Check! As you walk in you see the bar to your left - it has all of their wine stacked up behind a glass enclosure. You can see the manager picking out the wines for the night. It gives you something great to look at if you happen to eat/drink at the bar

Food - Check! They had a great variety of selection even for restaurant week. I had the vegetarian dish that was excellent. Not too much salt and all of the flavors blended nicely. Just the right portion size. My friend got the hanger steak. The steak was the right size, but the rosemary fries while delicious were just too much! It took 4 of us to finish all the fries.

Dessert - Check! They had a very unique version of tiramasu that was nice in presentation as well as taste. 

Drinks - Check! Good offerings of wine at various prices. The mixed drinks are very good. My friend got the Pear martini, but made the mistake of trying to eat the ""picked ginger"". I wish I had a picture of her face as she bit into it!",2009-03-02 14:44:50

After a day of Xmas shopping, we were hungry.  We spotted the diner from the road and were drawn in by large chainsaw carved wooden bear statues outside a knotty pine palace.  campy and fun.....

Thats where the fun ended.

Table for two, looking for tasty grub.  ME:  chorizo breakfast burrito, side of has browns EXTRA crispy please.  Companion:  Chicken parm (one of her favs, normally) and a coke please!

What happened:  Chicken parm was incinerated black, and my hash browns were albino white.  She claims her ""coke"" was really a pepsi, and felt betrayed by the waiter.  The breakfast burrito was a total disaster - rolled and cut in half, exposing a giant plug of ice cold refried beans, obviously from a can.  It was clear that the chef made no effort to 1) heat the beans, 2) season the beans, or 3) spread the beans evenly along the tortilla.  After some digging, I did find the chorizo, along with the eggs and jalapenos.

FORTUNATELY I recognize these things by sight, because none of them contained any flavor that might have identified them.  The chicken parm was similarly bland, despite the charring of the breading.  We were confused at the total lack of flavor in any of our food items; I even forgot to order w/o jalapenos, but I didn't notice until I saw them.

I really wanted to like this place, and the star is for the bears and decor.  But sadly, the best part of my meal was the ketchup.",2016-01-28 23:08:03

We shared the pork croquette as first course. It was phenomenal!! Highly recommend it as an appetizer. We then had the chicken 'n' watermelon 'n' waffles. Tasty but the croquette really stood out more for us. The two of us couldn't finish it.

We returned later for evening cocktails:
-Yardbird Old Fashioned: WAY too sweet for us and the smoky flavor from the bacon overpowered the spirit a bit.
-Porkchop: ""An unthinkable mix of Duke bourbon, Yardbird dijon syrup, yuzu juice & apple cider. Served in a highball & paired with a 1 ¼"" block ice with a dijon thyme cube."" When I ordered this, the server got a funny look on her face. ""What?"" I asked. She said that most people think it's interesting ""if you like herbs."" I started to change my order, but she insisted that I try it, saying I could trade it for something else if I didn't like it. IT WAS GREAT!

He was friendly, made conversation, and I'm pretty sure became friends with my mother - they were exchanging travel stories and even continued the evening speaking to each other in French! I can't say enough about great things about Terry. I will be requesting him for myself, and my guests in the future. Even my 9  month old nephew lit up every time Terry came around! He is a gem and a wonderful asset to The Capital Grille. **Tip: Your server will always have the best recommendation for you if you aren't sure what you want, but can tell them what you like.**

Torri M. is such a wonderful person. She's sweet, friendly, and always on top of things. I have worked with her for years, and I can't thank her enough for her generosity and kindness. I always look forward to seeing and speaking with her!

For the $50 lunch price I expected more.

Absolutely not worth it.  In my opinion, the lunch price tag should be $35-40.  I would much rather go to a good high end restaurant and have a more enjoyable meal.",2017-07-08 16:19:07
1809,548,2.0,"Very disappointing is all I can say.  We've been to the Twisted Grove many times because we love their food and the atmosphere.  However, our most recent trip proved to be very different, almost as if we were in an episode of Bar Rescue.... before the rescue!  My family and I went for dinner on a Tuesday evening. After we placed our orders, it was approximately 20 minutes later when our waitress Emma came to inform us they were out of chicken. How can you be out of chicken on a Tuesday evening at 7:30PM especially when that is one of your staple ingredients for quite a few dishes on the menu?!  After trying to make another selection, it turned out they were also out of the main ingredient for another  dish.  At this time we asked to speak to the manager.  After 10 minutes one of the managers named Travis appeared at our table.  He was completely disheveled and his shirt was dirty/stained, which did not help the situation.  When we explained our frustration and inquired if running out of food was an occurrence that also happens at their other three restaurants, Travis was quick to respond with, ""it's actually 5 restaurants.""  Really!?!  Seems to me Travis was completely missing the whole point and most concerning, was he didn't seem to even care.   Needless to say, we had guests with us and had spoken very highly about the Twisted Grove, so this was a very uncomfortable situation!  If we would have known they'd be out of food for some of their main dishes we would have gone elsewhere.  The only thing Travis did was correct the number of restaurants the group owns.  We were not looking for a free meal or anything like that, however we were looking for some acknowledgment or an apology, but at no point did Travis do or even say anything to attempt to rectify the issues at hand.  But wait there's more!  One of the dishes we ordered was the mushroom and Boursin cheese flatbread.  Every time we go, we order it and it's delicious.  When the flatbread was brought to the table we knew right away it was not made correctly because it looked very different and after tasting it, it tasted completely different.  Boursin cheese is a white crumbly cheese with garlic and various herbs in it.  The flatbread appeared to have only cheese on it which resembled Dofino cheese and it was paper thing, with no herbs to be seen and you certainly couldn't taste the garlic either.  In the past you could see the white colored Boursin cheese with its herbs on the top nicely melted, and you could taste it too! Not this time.  We called our waitress over and explained the situation.  Emma was very apologetic and sent the manager over.  Travis once again appeared and this time brought with him a little cup of cheese stating it was Boursin.  After looking at it and tasting it, yes it was Boursin, but that's not what was on the flatbread.  Travis then mentioned that the dish is actually made with Marscapone and 5 other types of cheese, not including the Boursin.  What - Really?!?!  That's the first time we'd ever heard about the dish having those other ingredients and it's not at all how it's written/described on the menu!  It was then very apparent that Travis was not only very unprofessional and uninformed, but judging from his behavior, and appearance, he just didn't care!  Needless to say we will not be recommending the Twisted Grove anytime soon.  The only positive from the evening's events was that our waitress Emma was very professional.  Maybe Travis should take some lessons from her and maybe the Twisted Grove should re-train their managers, including the teams in the kitchen and the chefs, to ensure they don't run out of food and that dishes are made correctly!",2018-04-01 04:21:15

256,413,3.0,"Food: Overall, the food is tasty, but the some of the items are overcooked or dry. An example meat that was overcooked was the Korean dry ribs. The nice thing about water is that they had a nice glass water bottle on the table for you to use and refill your glass at your own leisure.  I would have liked more food with the plastic syringe containing a syrup or sauce, but that's because I like fun food. :) There were only two that had them. The small cheese platter was delectable. I love how the food was small and cutely presented. The stirfry vegetables (Asian) was very chewy and overcooked. They should have pruned the vegetables, leaving the parts that were still fresh and cut them into more bite sized pieces. Yes, you can cut it, but it was so chewy that cutting it with the provided knife was not useful. I also loved the gelato section. I got the Thai tea gelato and it tasted heavenly. The deep fried tofu was so dry but the peanut sauce was yummy. My three favorite dishes were the bacon and tomato salad with candied bacon, the strawberry shortcake, and the best one, the crostini with grilled peach on top (DELICIOUS). I  ended up eating a lot because I was trying all sorts of things, but it was a fun experience. The best food is at the dessert and cold food sections for me.

Atmosphere: This place is beautifully decorated with a modern feel. It is located at the Cosmopolitan which has a modern interior too. We had dinner there on Wednesday night, so there was no line. Since there wasn't a lot of people there, we had a nice quiet dinner.

Service: For a place that charges me more than $30 a person ($34.99 to be exact for a Wednesday night), I expect the service to be more attentive/quick. Our table for two did not have room for the plates we were actively eating plus the plates we were finished using. I expected them to sweep in and remove the plates. They were rather slow and took their time doing so.

Bottom line: I give this buffet a 3.5 but am rounding down to 3 after having gone to the Bacchanal Buffet. :) You are welcome to check out my review of the Bacchanal Buffet on yelp too.",2012-09-20 15:27:36

Although I have always thought that eating crawfish involves too much work for the amount of meat, you have to try all their variations on the menu - crab, shrimp, oysters, and of course crawfish.

You can try their different seasonings but their best by far is the ""hot n juicy"" special. 

TIPS: 
Wear the bib - You may look a bit funny but trust me, you don't want to spill hot n juicy goodness all over your shirt.
Be prepared to smell - yes, hot n juicy goodness will follow you around for about a week, specially the smell of garlic in your hands.

We get there late and find that they have given up our room. Ok so we're off to a poor start, the front desk tries to ask us to pay for an upgrade to another room, but hello this is not our fault, so with that reasoning we get bumped up. 

We walk in and it is an astonishing view. Our room on the 50th floor faces the golf course and the beautiful waterfall behind it. The room is stunning with floor to ceiling windows and decorative mirrors. The shades are drawn by buttons in the middle console next to the beds. Not only are there 2 queen beds, there are two sinks and a vanity. There's a LCD in the bathroom, plasma in the main room and the alarm clock is an iHome iPod player that can charge our iPhones with. The room is amazing.

Downstairs there are several late dining facilities and stores that open till midnight and serve drinks like mimosas and sparkling wine while you peruse the products. I get giddy just thinking about how nice it was. 

The staff and promoters here were also very helpful. Being guests there we had instant access to the club, which opens up onto their outdoor waterfall. While the music was subpar which I find with many Vegas clubs the view was fabulous and the drinks were good.

I've been stalking Eggslut on IG for YEARS salivating over their pics. I've always known they were in LA, but ended up jumping on the bed this morning when I figured out there was a location in Vegas. I was SUPER geeked! I got dressed, walked 18min from MGM to the Cosmopolitan and stood in a 25min line (all things I have no problem doing for mouth-watering food) for a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. While I can appreciate the nice staff and their fast service, the sandwich itself was just not what I was expecting. I would say it's a little over-hyped, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I stood in line for 25+ min for a luke warm sandwich on an untoasted/unwarmed brioche bun. The over medium egg was almost took temperature, and the cheese wasn't even melted. I will say, their house-made turkey sausage tasted very good and the honey mustard aioli was a nice touch. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it better if the sandwich was actually served hot--as it should be. Overall I just didn't get the mind blowing experience that I was expecting. Definitely not going back during the rest of my stay, but I'll maybe try the LA location next time I'm there to see if it's any different.",2018-10-01 18:04:13

This is only a negative to me because it's false advertising, I actually preferred that they weren't overly cheesy.  I loved the walleye sandwich that I ordered.  I added the garlic which really gave it a nice punch.  The fries are very good.  Hand cut, dark, and crispy.  The slaw that comes with the sandwiches is so-so.  

The beer selection was very good (calibrated for Cleveland).  Although, as an out of towner, I would have like to see more local beers.  I could only find 1 Great Lakes beer and 1 Bells on tap.  They had 4-5 different Stone beers on tap.  Don't get me wrong - Arrogant Bastard is one of my favorite beers, but common have some pride Cleveland!  The Bells IPA that I had was delicious, I would have love to have more Bells or GLBC options.

I ordered the latter, and there must have been some miscommunication because it ended up being so small, I wouldn't even call it an appetizer. I'm surprised they both cost $30 for such vastly different amounts of food. I promptly called our waiter over, and he willingly switched my entree for the tofu toban yaki and vegetable stir fry. This ended up being cooked in flamed sake, and it had a rich sake flavor, which I think was pretty unique. However, I'm kind of disappointed and feel ripped off that I essentially paid $30 for tofu and vegetable stir fry that didn't even include unique vegetables. Ultimately, it kind of sucked that my girlfriend and I weren't able to eat at the same time.

After several visits for conferences or meetings, I knew that the canal was a pleasant place to enjoy a walk and stop for dinner, so I took the plunge and did something different.

1135,303,4.0,"My first trip the Caledonian was a bit of a mixed bag, and if Yelp had a 3.5 star rating, I'd be inclined to lean towards it.  However, I'm going to have to settle on a 3 star. 

Ok on to the details.....

Our group showed up at the Caledonian later in the evening for a night-cap and was told that on Thursday's the bar has last call at 1am. With a statutory holiday looming on the next day, a few fellow Yelpers piped up to say, ""Even on Holy Thursday!?' 

Yes...apparently even on Holy Thursday. 

Considering the bar was fairly full with patrons looking to unwind (get drunk) without the worry of an early morning the next day it certainly came as a bit of a surprise, and I'm sure the Caledonian missed out on a boatload of extra revenue. On the bright side, the waitress was more then understanding and let us nurse our beers until 2 am. (Disclaimer: After writing that last sentence, I adjusted the Yelp rating to a 4. Must give credit, where credit is due.)

The atmosphere and feel of the Caledonian is great and while I can't speak for the food they offer, they've got a great patio out back that smells like rich, new MDF board (Disclaimer 2: I once worked at a woodworking factory.

My son got a chocolate tarte and it was so rich he couldn't finish the small portion. The staff are very kind and even let my daughter use their restroom although it was not for customers.

I had hoes they would be better but that wasn't the case . We came with a group and were given group discounts and guarantees . Needless to say that wasn't the case at all. The front desk was rude , short , and not helpful st all. They charge your card without permission. We paid a deposit prior to coming . Paid the remainder upon check in , only to be charged another large sum the next morning . This is after we asked for a breakdown on paper , which the guys at the counter refused . We had a rental car and they synced our room keys twice , but every time we went in and out - they kept giving us a hard time . We would walk back inside and try to resolve the key again and the charges (parking was supposed to be included based off our group booking package ) . We were told it was covered by two separate people and then would get more charges on our card . So we would go back to try to fix . We did not experience good customer service our entire stay. The manager looked at us like we were dumb. They refused to be proactive and listen to our concerns and didn't offer any solutions to help us . I'll take my money elsewhere where it is wanted and appreciated . 

Plus the rooms are basic. No refrigerators or coffee in the rooms . Just not an overall nice place at all - should have learned after the first time last year .",2018-09-10 23:20:58
1143,373,5.0,"BG is the best stylist! I love my new hairdo. 

With summer around the corner, I wanted to cut my hair short... as in real short. I walked right in on a Saturday afternoon and was scheduled for an appt. later that evening. The lady at the front desk told me she would call if an opening came up. Sure enough, within the next 30 mins I received a call and was now ready to try a hairstyle that was new and sassy without being loud.  I wanted a pixie, but wasn't really sure and BG helped me by patiently  walking me through the various choices. We finally decided on one. Not once, during my time there did I feel like I needed to read a magazine. BG made me feel extremely comfortable and surprisingly enough I felt like I could trust her with my hair (remember, this was my 1st time ever here). BG hurt the inside of her palm a few days back and was extremely cautious with how she handled my hair (she even changed her band-aid, just so I felt clean and comfortable). I strongly suggest going here for the following reasons:
- Their staff is extremely friendly, yet professional.
- Trust me, their team KNOWS what they are doing.
- They are economically priced.

Kudos BG and the team, I will be coming back. Thank you guys, the compliments just won't stop! :D",2013-03-18 23:43:15

799,592,4.0,"To start off, Nobu has, hands down, one of the best restaurant decor & ambiance. It's super chill & laid back. We were seated quite quickly (5-10 min wait with a reservation) at a low, round couch like table which was extremely comfortable and we also had a great view of the whole restaurant. 
Our waitress was patient and very helpful in explaining the menu and also recommending Nobu's most famous & popular dishes (Sometimes her lip smacking got the best of me...but that can be overlooked).
What we ordered:
Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño (4 stars): I think this dish was well plated, really simple and delicate. The jalapeno complimented the flavors of the yellowtail well, a good hot substitute for wasabi. I would never think to pair the two, but the flavors really merged well.
Nobu Sashimi Tacos (4 stars): We ordered 4 tuna, 2 salmon, and 2 lobster. I think all were really  tasty. The shrimp cracker like shell made each bite crunchy and delicious! I recommend the tuna and lobster.
Broiled Alaskan Black Cod with Miso (3 stars): I'm not going to lie...I was underwhelmed. Yes, the texture of the fish is melt-in-your-mouth soft and flaky but the flavors didn't wow me. Tasted awfully similar to the miso my mother made when I was growing up. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary considering Nobu is ""Japanese with Peruvian flair."" Not sure I tasted the flair part at all in this dish. 
Overall, I think Nobu met my expectations. The decor bumps it to 4 stars otherwise I'd give the food 3.5 stars.",2017-07-01 02:39:43

603,15,3.0,"Lucky Foo's... My wife and I love you, but we're breaking up with you.  We've been here 6 times now (3 check-ins on yelp) but you have a chronic glaring service problem that we have to consciously prepare ourselves (and friends we bring) for- every time we come.  And, we're not sure we'll be back again because of it.

Arrival was nice- hostess walked to the front, greeted us, confirms reservation and sat us, per usual.

Today is Valentine's day, and my wife made a reservation for a 1pm brunch.
We sat down and it might have been (trying to be favorable to the restaurant here) at least 10 minutes before someone came and asked if we'd like to start with drinks.  My wife a bloody mary and water, myself- an espresso and water.
We also ordered starters but said we were not ready to order entrees yet.

Water was served shortly after, and the bloody mary shortly after that.  Espresso never came.  

25 minutes in:  
Starters were served and the gentlemen putting them on the table asked if he could take our menus, and I informed him that we hadn't ordered yet.  The gentleman says ""Oh, i thought you already had!"" Correct sir, I feel like we already should have, but the waitress never came back to check in for 15 minutes after taking the starters and drinks.
Waitress comes: my wife orders the Lox with a side egg.  I order the poached eggs.

40 minutes in: Finished our starters.  No one has checked in at the table.  Still no espresso.  The young girl finally checked in to see if we wanted more water, and I asked if she could check on the espresso.  She did- came back and stated they were out of stock.  I wasn't that invested so I requested no substitute drink- they did offer. 

50 minutes in:  My food is delivered- my wife's side of egg is delivered, and at THAT moment is when they inform us that they are out of stock on the lox, so they never made her plate!  At no time previously did the come out and present this, so she might adjust her order & we could eat together- on Valentine's day.  she passed on a change of order at this juncture, because we agree'd that it would have been more of a hassle to try to order something else at this time.

75 minutes in:  I finish eating.  Fortunately the starters helped my wife not be so annoyed that she didn't have a proper meal.  We're about to ask for the check when suddenly the woman, that I can assume should be our waitress, brings out an espresso!  She said there had been trouble with the machine.  I'm agreeable- I enjoy a cup at the end of the meal just as much as the start.
No coffee accessories were delivered. I know that espresso is usually straight, but it wasn't offered either. 

I'm pretty laissez-faire about things when it comes to service.  My wife- less so.  I just want to enjoy some good food and company, but this inability to inform us that things are out of stock, or that you're having issues, and allowing us to change our minds so we may still have a nice Valentine's brunch together, did rub me the wrong way.  I should not have to even think about the service.  This time in particular, the staff was fervently apologizing to the table next to us for something also!  We don't know the particulars but we weren't terribly surprised either, as we prepare ourselves.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example of the level of service that happens here EVERY time we've come.  The food here is truly outstanding, both cooked in back & from the sushi bar..  We LOVE it.  It's unique, creative, delicious.  Your Cedar Plank Salmon on the forbidden rice is my favorite salmon dish in the city.  (once served to me raw/cold in the middle)
 
But dealing with the level of service has become a real chore.

Previous visit:  Server delivered wife's entree- held it up in the air- 1 inch from her face until she took it from the server's hands.  in retrospect, my wife thinks the fella might be special needs, so she forgave it.  But please, just set the plate down on the table.
Previous visit: Delivered me the wrong order.  Made my correct order which, again, staggered my wife eating her plate then I'm eating mine.
Different visit: Delivered us another table's order.
Our second visit there: Had no waitress.  20 minutes in, actually had someone come to our table and apologize for no service, and hostess came to help and take our drink order.

We LOVE your food.  We love the design, and the feel of the place.  The music is relaxed but upbeat at the same time- perfect choices. We love how you try so hard to make up for your errors.  The people are so nice.  But like a relationship partner that just keeps falling short-  we leave feeling a little disappointed- every time.

I have also ordered to go on a number of occasions and have had no problems.
Another plus, for me at least, they are family friendly.  I bring my 3 and 4 year old here at least once a week.  These kids eat at least 10 pieces of salmon each; it's their favorite food.  That would cost me $30-40 dollars anywhere Else, at Teharu it's $10-15 dollars.  
The sushi is simple here, they don't have a bunch of exotic rolls if that is your thing.  They keep it cold inside, which I love but my girlfriend bring her sweater with her.

What can I say, we had an amazing time. We still love the hotel, the rooms, the restaurants, the bars, the pool, the entire ambiance of the hotel basically...Housekeeping this time seemed to be on top of things, no issues with them at all. I think our room was cleaned before 2pm if not earlier. 

We made the mistake of going to the Bellagio for another 2 nights...and this is really what showed us the difference.....after staying at the Cosmopolitan, it's VERY HARD to go anywhere else...the Bellagio just did not stand a chance...everything was wrong...(but that's another review on it's own)

So, I recommend, you go to Cosmopolitan and give them a try...you will not be disappointed...and if you have any issues, do let them know so they can make it right. They have their heart in the right place...

Restaurants/bars: Chandelier bar, great place to people watch/have a drink....the pizza place, still yummy pizza for that cheaper dinner  option (and did I mention I'm originally from the East Coast and  think that NY pizzas are the best..), STK, for an amazing dinner, with amazing waiters....The Henry -for excellent breakfast, the bartender guys are awesome, friendly and remembered us still!

My reservation amount was $522.50 including tax and resort fees.  When I checked out, they charged me $17 more on top of my booking amount because the hotel staff said that the resort fees was increased on January 1st and third party reservations like booking.com doesn't usually get updates from the hotel.  As a customer, that is not my fault, I agreed to pay $522.50 when I booked the hotel so the hotel should honor the same.  Hard Rock hotel did not honor my booking reservations, so I have to pay more that the agreement price.  Not very good customer service.

About the room...poor lighting every where, toiletries provided was used, not enough sitting area, beds are lopsided, and TV channel selection SUCKS!

First of all, don't come here if you're hungry.  The portions are small and I left feeling like I was taken.  Here's why....
The service was okay, the atmosphere was okay - nothing spectacular for Las Vegas.  We had the goat cheese fundido for an appetizer and it was good.  It had a very nice meld of flavors that complimented each other.  I ordered the shrimp tacos.  It was literally two tacos, two skewers of three shrimp each, cabbage, and two home made tortillas.  It came with a side of diced avocado, verde salsa and something else that I didn't try.  The shrimp were medium size - so like I said, if you're hungry try another place. 
My friend had the Mesa Burger.  This was pretty darn good.

The star of the show was the French fries.  They had some type of spice on them that was delicious and crunchy.

In our first visit we sat at the bar and had items from the happy hour menu, the friendly sushi chef in front of us gave us excellent recommendations and great service. He is originally from Mexico city and has been preparing sushi for many years, we left him a good tip . Here are some of our favorite dishes: Cajun albacore sashimi, Fire cracker, Spicy salmon roll, Salmon carpaccio, Creamy sesame trout, among others.

557,211,5.0,"Not just the best Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. The best restaurant in Charlotte. I have had much more expensive/fancy dining experiences in the city, but I've not had food so good or service that is even in the same ballpark. 
The owner is simply amazing. She remembers everyone! She knows where we sat, what we ate and is a treasure. When we were overwhelmed by the menu or unsure about what to try, she has been ready to make something just for us to meet our tastes. And while she is a one of a kind lady, her staff are all good too, all very friendly and attentive. 
I wish that I could try more of her menu, but I love the Bun so much that I might cry if I went here and didn't get it. Bun is so simple, and until I got it here at Lang Van I was mostly of the opinion that Bun is Bun. Some better than others, but the differences were minor. But at Lang Van it was incredible. Each of the meats was delicious on its own, and the crisp rolls are tasty as well. 
The wife isn't as addicted to Bun as I am, so she tries more on the menu and is never disappointed. I get to try her dishes as well, so best of both worlds for me. We get the fresh summer rolls, as they are always great and my wife would probably divorced me in order to marry that peanut sauce if it were an option. 
We finish everything off with the coffee and leave incredibly happy. You definitely should go here. Go here often. Stop reading reviews and go! Now!",2016-02-23 20:09:14

We were seated promptly as we arrived on time for our reservation.  I was surprised the restaurant was not packed given Spring Training, and convention were in town.  
The wine list seems paired down since our last visit as there weren't the same number of selections for whites and reds as I remember from the list.  We both ordered various glasses of white wines for first course and entrée.
What I was most happy with is Roy's Trio and Classic Four were cooked perfectly.  Too many items on our last visit seemed to be pre-cooked waiting for warming up as items were ordered.
Roy's Maui has always rated 5 stars because of better service, better wine list and overall better food execution.  We were there just this past December and no, I don't add the location as a boost for that Roy's.

After a day of Xmas shopping, we were hungry.  We spotted the diner from the road and were drawn in by large chainsaw carved wooden bear statues outside a knotty pine palace.  campy and fun.....

Thats where the fun ended.

Table for two, looking for tasty grub.  ME:  chorizo breakfast burrito, side of has browns EXTRA crispy please.  Companion:  Chicken parm (one of her favs, normally) and a coke please!

What happened:  Chicken parm was incinerated black, and my hash browns were albino white.  She claims her ""coke"" was really a pepsi, and felt betrayed by the waiter.  The breakfast burrito was a total disaster - rolled and cut in half, exposing a giant plug of ice cold refried beans, obviously from a can.  It was clear that the chef made no effort to 1) heat the beans, 2) season the beans, or 3) spread the beans evenly along the tortilla.  After some digging, I did find the chorizo, along with the eggs and jalapenos.

FORTUNATELY I recognize these things by sight, because none of them contained any flavor that might have identified them.  The chicken parm was similarly bland, despite the charring of the breading.  We were confused at the total lack of flavor in any of our food items; I even forgot to order w/o jalapenos, but I didn't notice until I saw them.

I really wanted to like this place, and the star is for the bears and decor.  But sadly, the best part of my meal was the ketchup.",2016-01-28 23:08:03

First time was like 3 star experience... decent amount of beers on tap and solid happy hour food list. The bartender was a chick who was cute and was able to shoot the shit with us pretty well, I was impressed.

The look and decor of the place is impressive and swanky, reminds me of back home in LA. 

As I was ready to leave, it was pretty busy, and there was a huge group of older guys. Above average first experience.

The second time was on a Saturday a couple weeks ago and my buddies wanted to check out a cool spot for food and drinks in Scottsdale so I took them here and it ended up being a good call.

For lunch, this place is awesome as we got to sit outside on the couches, got some GREAT cocktails (not cheap though) and my Pork Belly was really good.

1st experience 3 stars, nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either.

2nd experience, 5 stars, chill lunch atmosphere with good food and good drinks...

The service was very friendly and attentive, and went above and beyond as to explain what each dish contained, without compromising the secret ingredients :) The two biggest dishes left on my mind and palate were the sunchoke spring rolls with roasted truffle mayo, along with the almond tofu cheesecake with blueberry ginger compote and almond butter. The spring rolls defies the regular image of a spring roll using phyllo pastry, which also complimented the sunchoke filling. The roasted truffle mayo gave a nice umami kick to the spring rolls.

The tofu cheesecake was light, fluffy and not too sweet, to my delight. the blueberry ginger compote helped to alleviate any heaviness (if any), from the cheesecake, ending the meal with a very pleasant high note.

Inside security both USA and Canada are limited as well, with restaurants and shopping being limited in their choice.

So let me just get this off my chest, I HATE WHEN BUFFETS CUT THE LEGS IN HALF.  Not only is the meat cold by the time you get back to the table but they are dried up.  The only way to eat crab legs is keeping them whole and cracking them yourself.  I know what people are thinking......""I hate cold crab legs and that is the only time they are whole"".  WRONG.  AT the bistro buffet you get the whole cold crab legs and hand them to the cook.  He then will steam them for about 1 minute and the result.....perfect hot crab legs that I miss so much.  Well done bistro buffet. 

In addition to the crab legs all the other food is amazing and cooked perfect.  The selection is huge and I would highly recommend this buffet before some of the other expensive ones.

On a side note, always be aware of your surroundings for dangerous crab leg crackers.  Its very easy to get shot in the face by some crab meat.  Its happened to me many times.  My girlfriend has gotten the best distance I've ever seen.  She cracked a leg and meat shot sideways over this guys head about 5 feet and he had no idea this happened.

I have been driving by this place for a couple of years now and have always wanted to stop in, but it was usually on my way to work (don't have time to stop) or after they were closed. Driving home today, I suddenly realized that I am right in front of it, and I don't have anywhere specific to be at the moment... Perfect!

It is a very cute, dark little place that seems very comfortable.

There were some customers hanging out, and one of the baristas walked over from a table and greeted me along her way to behind-the-counter. I was getting ready to order my typical drink (iced latte w/honey drizzle), but I wanted to make sure they had honey available first, so I asked her. She showed me the bottle kept behind the counter, so I proceeded to order my latte.

She offered to put the honey in with the espresso so it melts, which is much appreciated, but I actually prefer it drizzled over the ice once it's done because I get a couple chunks and then the remainder slightly sweetens the latte. It was pretty cute, though, 'cause she kept trying to be really helpful with the honey, so it ended up being a little more complicated than it needed to be...I'm used to just ordering a latte and drizzling it myself at the condiment bar, so I didn't think to specify, and I actually think it's great that she was being so accomodating, so I'm not complaining at all (although the guy behind me might not have thought it was as cute as I did, ha). But she was really friendly the whole time, and we were having a conversation about different types of milk and blah blah blah, and then she finished the drink and allowed me to drizzle my honey on it.

I thanked her and picked up my latte, lid, and straw to assemble it somewhere else so I could get out of the way of the guy behind me, and then I realized that I was still holding on to my money. ""Oh, I guess I should pay you, ha!""

I'll definitely go back to Matador Coffee when I'm in the area. The service was fantastic, and my latte was good as well.

Here you will find a huge selection of food, anything from beef, pork, lamb, seafood and even vegetarian. Everything I sampled would rival entrees from most any sit down restaurant you will find. For me the highlight was the Alaskan King Crab legs, they were perfectly cooked, large, meaty and pre-split. It's rare that I find crab of this quality. I find the prime rib equally prepared, cooked to a perfectly medium rare. The various pork and chicken dishes were excellent. Of the vegetable sides I sampled the mashed potatoes (real potatoes), green beans, corn, salad, etc., all were delicious. Of the few breads I sampled were also very good. In short this was a buffet that really was one of the best meals I had had in quite a while, I left satisfied and overstuffed. 

Now the bad, at just under $40 it's quite expensive. It's also a good idea to try and arrive just about opening, the lines can get quite long. Given the quality and variety of food it really isn't a bad deal in my view. Just make sure you're hungry when you go. For a buffet The Buffet it's as good as it gets.",2013-10-24 15:19:09

I love the feel and the idea of the greenery and artifacts in the back which give for great after-ceremony photos (exactly what most of the venues in the city are missing). My biggest gripe is with their 'soft holds policy'. Personally, I have no issues with this. So, after touring on a Saturday and falling in love, I tell them my fiancé and I will be back the next weekend with family because we want to lock down our October date that is still open. They tell us thats great, set an appointment, but again make it clear they cannot do a 'soft hold'. 

The following Saturday 9 of us show up. Tell them we're probably going to book, and they mention another bride is INTERESTED...There are no soft holds though, so it shouldn't matter-right? So while I'M there touring with my family, the owner calls the other bride telling her there is someone else touring that is REALLY interested (I witnessed the call first-hand when I walked in to their office to ask for pricing to show my dad whom hadn't seen it). The owner is on the phone for a long while, and comes back to say 'the other bride is on her way down (!!!!!) but it's whoever gets the money in our hand first that gets the date, since we don't do soft holds'. When my dad says alright, we're ready, the owner says 'I don't want you making a rash decision because you feel pressure'. 

At this point I'm almost ready to cry out of pure frustration, and tell the owner point blank, 'If we walk out now so you can talk to the other bride, we will not be back'. 

Ultimately we got the date we wanted, and the other bride got her secondary date, and came over to congratulate us after booking. Kudos to the other bride, but hopefully The Castle owners will provide for a better experience going forward and not make us regret investing thousands in this place. 

Will update as things progress, and hopefully be able to increase the stars because I do think the place is absolutely stunning.",2013-12-07 02:44:34
312,413,3.0,"This buffet is located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. The overall ambience is nice and feels upscale. Like most buffets there are a variety of sections such as salad, meat, seafood, and dessert.

I think they prioritized quantity over quality, as most of the food was nothing special. However, the highlights for me were the prime rib and dessert bar. You can ask to get the prime rib grilled, and there is rosemary sauce too.

It cost $52 per person, before tip, at dinner on a weekend. That's equivalent to 6.5 Chipotle burritos. I would take the 6 burritos over a single buffet entry any day.

The bathroom was amazing with a huge tub, glass shower, two sinks, and LCD TV.  Oh yea, and of couse there is the toilet.  Durr.  The layout of the suite is perfect.  You walk in and there are two SUPER comfy beds with a big flat screen.  A few steps below is another section with a huge L shaped couch and another TV.  I also loved how you have a remote to draw the curtains and shades.  This is KEY when you are hungover in the morning and can't seem to get up.  One press of the button and the 11am sunlight streams into your bedroom and you can't help but wake up. :)

848,621,5.0,"This review is a long time coming from me.  Only having lived in the Gilbert area for about 9 years, I have been able to see much of the old town grow into a more upscale, urban vibe to it that sort of meshes well with the dusty, tumbleweed blowing across the street scene that it is.  Confusing and sort of awesome all in one, the little old street in Gilbert has become a place of choice not only for me, but throngs of east valley residents as well.  There are too many good places to eat in this area and this is a good problem.  
The review:
Liberty has been a place I have been ordering take-out from for over two years now and my actual dine-in experience has been minimal. Parking is reasonable though can at times be difficult with Postino's, Joe's, and Oregano's all smashed together.  Phone-in orders are always courteous, almost always fully accurate with special order types, and the wait has never been prolonged.  The restaurant is clean and just fun to look at.  
Food is delicious.  I have not sampled the entire menu but it is varied and well thought out.  Pricey?  Maybe.  I have learned that more imaginative and fresh food equals a more premium price and for the most part, I accept this.  
As a creature of habit, I can speak on the salmon blt with authority; never fishy, good char on the bun, bacon is always delicious, tomatoes are thick and red.  Sandwiches are clever with designer cheese and excellent breads.  Homemade kettle-styled chips = yum!  
Breakfast is also varied and delicious.  
Coffee bar:  This is my favorite region of  Liberty.  I have shed the Starbucks addiction and moved to more local coffee houses that can replicate a good cappuccino.  Liberty can do this to my satisfaction.  The baristas are knowledgeable and friendly.  They will remember your order and chat with you if not too busy.  Adult coffee drinks?  Sign me up.  
I love this place.  I want to move in to this place.  I dislike people.  Herein lies the problem.  The times I can visit are always peak when there are throngs of 
obnoxious humans and the acoustics are terrible.  Navigating the Yukon models of strollers to a table is an exercise in patience and contortion; space between tables is at a premium.  
Is this a place to quietly work on your laptop with a cup of coffee? Depends on the time.  Is this a place to get an excellent coffee drink?  Yes.  Food is delicious and the atmosphere is engaging.  
Pros:  Food and coffee drinks; decor and yes, bathrooms have character.
Cons:  (Peak hours) Parking, too much humanity in one establishment, acoustics.  
  
The Joe's chain has another winner.",2013-08-05 18:50:32

492,637,3.0,"I was in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show and this place was highly recommended by some of the convention attendees.

But a quick note I learned on my visit to the ""I Love Burgers"" restaurant at the Palazzo Hotel ....the restaurant was in the middle of a long soft opening and they were still fine tuning the tastes, servings, servers, and prices of the menu. I will explain how I found out it was a soft opening. With that in mind, I actually l gave the restaurant more forgiveness than I would give most other restaurants.

The talk from some of the attendees was the ""I Love Bacon"" gourmet burger. The restaurant's menu explained the burger as ""..a blend of ground sirloin and applewood-smoked bacon, crispy bacon, bacon mayo, smoked gouda, onion strings, and brioche-style bun"".  The burger was a wonderful blend of meaty flavors. I liked the burger because I Love Bacon, but honestly, for the a la carte burger, it was $17 (See my pic).....if you want more toppings than stated on the menu, other toppings like caramelized onions, jalepenos, mushrooms, extra bacon, etc cost an extra $1-$7 per extra topping....OH NO....and I still needs the fries!

Since we still have to purchase the fries, the restaurant actually has a list of gourmet fries to suit any taste. We chose the regular fries and the Parmesan Garlic fries. The regular fries were better than the non garlic fries. We mentioned to our server that the garlic fries were cold and it lacked the taste of garlic. The server apologized, but that is when I learned it was a soft opening of the restaurant. They did not charge us for those fries.....THANK YOU!

These are gourmet burgers, it was tasty, but I wish the prices were more visitor friendly. I know this is a Vegas Strip restaurant and the prices are justified, but I will probably find another place next time around.

It came with a long sliced of Andouille sausage, a tasty shrimp creole, tender and nicely spiced craw-fish etoufee, HOT red beanz 'n' rice (my favorite!), a bite sized ear of corn, and a slice of hot french bread.

The to-go orders are picked up at the bar and the food is sectioned out so most items are kept separated. The server opened the container and asked that we check it before leaving to ensure it was as it should be, and then bagged it and gave my 5-year old granddaughter a neckful of beads to wear out!

We made a reservation at Mon Ami Gabi for dinner on the 4th of July. We sat inside and were waited on my Michelle, who was outstanding. When we got to the table they brought us an amuse bouche of orzo salad (yum) and their french bread...warm, crusty, oh-so-satisfying.
We started our meal with a few drinks and also ordered the baked cheese. So, so good....I am craving it right now. It's basically a mixture of soft cheeses (cream cheese, goat cheese, etc.) that are baked in the oven, mixed with fresh marinara sauce, and served with toasted french bread drizzled in basil garlic oil. There were only two of us and we basically licked the bowl clean...it was that good.
For our meals we both got the signature filet mignon with merlot butter and red wine reduction. I got the asparagus for my side and my friend got the fries. The portions were surprisingly large and the meat was impeccably cooked. The filet was soft and well seasoned....melted in my mouth. Without a doubt, the best steak I have ever had (and funnily enough also one of the cheapest). The asparagus was fresh and delicious. I also stole quite a few fries from across the table...those things are addictive. 
We ended the meal with creme brulee. The custard was sweet and creamy and rich....exactly what I wanted. 
Overall, a fantastic meal. I couldn't pick out a single flaw (and I can almost always pinpoint more than one). During our meal I looked around the nearby tables and picked up on a few conversations, and everyone was commenting on how spectacular the food and service were...lots of happy people and bellies.

Toby Keith has a great atmosphere and the waitress wear assless chaps. That took me completely by surprise. Our waitress quickly took our order and was prompt on delivery.

I ordered the combo fajitas which was $25. Unfortunately the food is extremely lacking. Every meal ordered by our party of 9 was disappointing. My meats were bland and flavor less. One of my groups mentioned that my steaks were beef jerky. The food quality wouldn't have been so bad if the prices weren't so unbelievably high for the food. I wouldn't return to this location.

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

Riding an UBER to this location cost $39 uber xl
I really don't know how we ended up here because this was about 25 minutes or 11 miles away from the strip.  My only guess is that we needed a quiet place away from the craziness and needed a hometown feeling, this provided very well.

I expected this place to be tiny since everyone said it was a local casino.  I was wrong. This place was huge.  Once walking in, I felt a very nice Vibe.  A Live Band was playing some cool songs and the place just gave me a relaxed feeling which I needed.  The locals who I have met were wonderful.  The servers, the bartenders, the performers were very inviting.
In a matter of minutes, I too felt like a local since they treated me as such.  

There were relaxing seats all over the bar where I just plopped on down, listening to the music being played, people watching, having a nice beer or two or three or four, and just had my groove on.  People introduced themselves and we gave high fives to one another while saying cheers and long life as our beer bottles clanked as we toasted the night away.

I am very happy that I found this place.  I definitely look forward to coming back here and probably will stay at this hotel.  This place was refreshing.  After a hard days work, I can imagine sitting and drinking a few cold ones here and literally enjoying it. Thank You Sunset.

First of all, don't come here if you're hungry.  The portions are small and I left feeling like I was taken.  Here's why....
The service was okay, the atmosphere was okay - nothing spectacular for Las Vegas.  We had the goat cheese fundido for an appetizer and it was good.  It had a very nice meld of flavors that complimented each other.  I ordered the shrimp tacos.  It was literally two tacos, two skewers of three shrimp each, cabbage, and two home made tortillas.  It came with a side of diced avocado, verde salsa and something else that I didn't try.  The shrimp were medium size - so like I said, if you're hungry try another place. 
My friend had the Mesa Burger.  This was pretty darn good.

The star of the show was the French fries.  They had some type of spice on them that was delicious and crunchy.

619,142,2.0,"We knew we wanted ramen while in Vegas (hot soup in the desert? Oh, yeah), but didn't know where to go.

A fabulous-facial-haired Yelp buddy had written a stellar review of this place, and we knew this was the place to be. So, we made reservations (totally unnecessary) for lunch.

The place was pretty empty at noon on a Sunday, but filled up pretty quickly. We were seated, offered drinks, and ordered from the prix fixe menu.

+First course: Social House green salad with baby mesclun, tomato, and julienne slices of some root vegetable. It was dripping in the ginger dressing. It was tasty, but I wasn't interested in drinking my salad.

+Second course: Tonkotsu ramen, pork broth, a slab of pork, served with a soft-boiled egg and some fried garlic bits. The broth tasted kinda funny, so we added a splash of soy sauce for some flavor, broke open the yolk to add some creaminess, and sprinkled in the fried bits of garlic for some bite. It helped tremendously. I finished the entire bowl. Woo, proud member of the Clean Plate Club!

+Third course: spicy tuna cut roll. Here's where the problem lies: I don't know about you, but I cannot stand it when sushi has creamy ingredients added to it. Save the mayonnaise for sandwiches and the cream cheese for bagels. When I order sushi, I want simplicity; the flavors of the rice, nori, and fish must be able to stand alone, otherwise, I begin to wonder what you're trying to hide with that huge dollop of aioli. End rant. Anyway, with all that said, the sushi was NOT my favorite. Even the shrimp tempura cut roll had a ton of aioli added to the already-creamy avocado. What gives?

1156,61,1.0,"I'm sorry to have to do this, but the owner of this place is a jerk.  I got yelled at, for playing pinball in a way that has helped me play very well in pinball tournaments and leagues over the years, and not one time has anyone, including the owners of some very rare and valuable games, mentioned anything to me about abusing a machine.  But that wasn't the case here at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  Instead, I was told (in a very confrontational way) that new Stern machines were all made of plastic, the flipper buttons (of course), the sides (huh?) and the legs (did he really just say that?!?) and that I better calm down or I would be asked to leave.  BULL$HIT.  He treated me like a moron--flat out lied to me thinking I must not know any better.  This was after he stood about 5 feet away from me with his arms crossed watching very disapprovingly as I would hit the side of an Avatar machine to keep the ball from exiting the right orbit and dropping into the right sling.  Watch just about any pinball video or tutorial and it's pretty clear this is the sorta thing you have to do to control the ball and continue playing.  It also does absolutely nothing to harm the game, and hitting the side with a sledgehammer certainly wouldn't have caused a pop bumper to be non-functional, or the one-way gate at the top of the left orbit to be jammed up, as they were on this particular machine.  It also wouldn't have caused AC/DC to be about 5 degrees off level.  And to make matters worse, I never encountered a tilt warning on AC/DC, Avatar, or the one EM I played before I was warned for a second time for making a very light slap save.

I would think that Mr. Tim Arnold, of such long standing participation in the world of pinball operation, maintenance and collecting would know how to set a tilt bob to prevent players from being able to move the game in the slightest, since that's apparently what he wants. I can now only assume that's much too difficult a task, and it doesn't give him an opportunity to eject people that obviously know what the hell they're doing on a pinball machine, and that might otherwise complain about the poor operational condition of most of the games in his establishment.  I chose to leave on my own after the second warning during which time I was followed out the door while continuing to be berated.  I have no desire to ever go back and give this guy another quarter, so he can flip it all to the Salvation Army (400k last year) while continuing to let his games sit broken and refusing help from volunteers to get them repaired in a reasonable time frame.  You'd think he could take some of that money and invest it back into the place but I guess that's now how he wants to do business.  It keeps the ""complainers"" away.",2012-09-10 20:55:22
539,46,3.0,Not sure why this buffet has such terrible reviews but now that I write this I went from 4-3 stars. There was a large selection of food. It was decent however went back for another slice of pizza and the dough was still raw. I do wish they had vegan options for desert. I can't have dairy so couldn't have any desert items as they didn't offer anything for vegans. Your drinks are also self serve which was kinda a hassle. It was missing a pasta bar our families favorite part of a buffet.,2018-03-23 14:50:00
1290,207,5.0,"If you're looking for a Chinese restaurant that's of a higher scale, and doesn't taste like you're typical all-breading Chinese place, you've just found it. The place is exquisite, and I can't recommend it enough.

The lemon chicken is some of the best I've ever had, perfectly cooked every time, in a delicious, light and sweet sauce. The same can be said about their other staples, like their sweet and sour, and general tsou's. The atmosphere is fantastic, classy, and tranquil. Service is impeccable. One some nights, they even have live music perform, and it's some of the best atmosphere I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying.

Unfortunately, I've since become a celiac, and can't have gluten. Their gluten-free options are very limited, but I can't mark that against them as it's kinda hard to make Chinese food without using flour. If you can eat gluten, this place is the chinese food lover's dream.",2016-03-20 19:12:03

This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating.

890,106,2.0,"This was my first visit to Topgolf. The security guard outside wouldn't let me in with my water bottle. It's Arizona in May. You should be able to go everywhere with water bottles, this is a safety issue. When I tried to explain this to the security guard, he made me throw it in the trash. (When I later got into my bay, one of the bays next to us was passing a flask around.) That didn't give me a very good first impression of the business and I hadn't even made it in the door yet. 

I ordered a membership card online prior to arriving because I was told that it would be easier than waiting in line to buy one there. I still had to wait in line to pick it up and when I did, they had no record of my purchase. When I showed them my receipt email on my phone, the receipt that was sent to me was for another person. I spoke with a manager and forwarded him the emails so that he could send it to corporate to investigate. Safe to say, I'm a bit nervous that they can't keep receipts straight in email I'm worried about them having my credit card information. 

All in all, a negative first experience. I will wait to see how the membership issue is resolved, but as it stands right now I was not impressed enough to want to give them any more of my money.",2017-05-26 05:05:11

We had made a reservation for 9 and got there around 8:30 and they were able to seat us after about 10 minutes. Our waitress came over pretty quickly after we sat down but then it just went downhill from there. We had ordered drinks and the waitress brought my friend the wrong beer. We then ordered edamame and a bunch of sushi cut rolls, We were really hungry b/c we had just traveled to Vegas and went straight to dinner from the airport. We ordered the spicy tuna, salmon avocado, shrimp tempura and spicy scallop rolls. It then took about 45 mins. to get our rolls and we were starving! We ate those rolls pretty fast once they got to the table. We were still hungry, so for some reason we thought it would be a good idea to get some more rolls. Bad idea. The next set of sushi rolls took another hour. We almost wanted to cancel the order b/c it was taking so long. We were hungry but also tired and just wanted to get out of there. 

After we finally got the second set of sushi rolls, we immediately asked for our bill b/c we knew that would take a while, which we were right about. 

After about another 20 minutes, we were able to pay our bill and leave. 

As far as the sushi goes, it was really good. Our favorite was the shrimp tempura. Our least favorites were the spicy scallop and tuna b/c they were not spicy. 

The whole meal lasted almost 2.5 hours, which is pretty ridiculous. Not sure if I would go back b/c I don't think I have the patience.",2011-01-11 02:56:14

1544,426,4.0,"I confess, the only reason my boyfriend & I tried the place was the coupon for a free appetizer.  The place had only been only open a few weeks so we decided we'd go gawk & giggle.  We made reservations but were seated immediately (kudos to the hostess!).  
The main annoyance I noticed was the noise level.  The decor is charming & sophisticated but the acoustics are atrocious and not conducive to an intimate dining experience.
On the other hand, the food was awesome.  Granted, we chose a fairly white-trash fare: mac & cheese and sweet potatoe fries as sides, but it was still amazingly tasty.  We ordered the lobster rolls as our appetizer (gotta get the most out of that coupon!).  I enjoyed lovely chicken sandwich, my guy had a thick, juicy burger.

1394,902,5.0,"5 stars for the food, the concept and the execution! I love banh mi and knowing that Toronto has a large Chinatown, I was very excited to see what they had to offer. When doing my research, I found a lot of potentially great establishments but the Banh Mi Boys concept just popped off the list as not only having a quality banh mi with a strong selection of meats, but also Asian inspired tacos and steamed bao.

The roll on the banh mi was top notch and even held up well to the meatballs with a generous amount of tomato hoisin sauce we had. The meatballs were tasty and tender and everything I was hoping for. Despite there being a bit too much sauce, I really enjoyed the combination. The 5 spice pork belly bao had a generous, thick slice of pork belly and was surprisingly well balanced. The pork belly was nicely seared and had some fat on it but was plenty meaty and 5 spice wasn't overpowering like it can be sometimes. The pickled veg cut through the richness and made for a pork belly bun that is one of the best I've had.

The best one of the bunch though was the kalbi taco with a roti pancake replacing the traditional tortilla and banh mi style toppings along with kimchee and cabbage slaw. Reasonably spicy with jalapeno sticks, the short rib was perfectly seasoned and we devoured it quickly. 

I walked out of the busy restaurant hoping that something like it would come to Rochester and loving the concept so much that I found myself dreaming of opening a similar establishment. Must see!",2012-08-20 16:17:16

I've been stalking Eggslut on IG for YEARS salivating over their pics. I've always known they were in LA, but ended up jumping on the bed this morning when I figured out there was a location in Vegas. I was SUPER geeked! I got dressed, walked 18min from MGM to the Cosmopolitan and stood in a 25min line (all things I have no problem doing for mouth-watering food) for a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. While I can appreciate the nice staff and their fast service, the sandwich itself was just not what I was expecting. I would say it's a little over-hyped, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I stood in line for 25+ min for a luke warm sandwich on an untoasted/unwarmed brioche bun. The over medium egg was almost took temperature, and the cheese wasn't even melted. I will say, their house-made turkey sausage tasted very good and the honey mustard aioli was a nice touch. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it better if the sandwich was actually served hot--as it should be. Overall I just didn't get the mind blowing experience that I was expecting. Definitely not going back during the rest of my stay, but I'll maybe try the LA location next time I'm there to see if it's any different.",2018-10-01 18:04:13

Fearing I wouldn't be able to return back to the main room, I ended up just staying inside. Despite the packed crowd, everyone was friendly and gave it a fun atmosphere. A&B's set was also really enjoyable and kept the energy up. At one point, they directed a snide remark towards will.i.am for his rip off of Rebound which left the crowd cheering.

The Vietnamese ox tail broth noodle was good ( wish it was hotter in temperature). The rest of the food were just typical buffet food.  It could be the weekday menu, there was no sliders and sweet potato fries. The last time we were here, there was more options.",2018-07-04 16:10:00

Unlike the Fast and Fix place in Downtown Summerlin, the woman that works there doesn't even know my watch, and asked me how much its worth and told me that it would be $125.00 to change battery on my watch and to take out some links on a new watch would be $25.00.  We brought our business here at M & I, it cost only $25.00 for the battery and $10.00 to remove links on the new watch.

We went on a Saturday evening and they were already out of about half of the options (including the cookies). The food was ok, and nobody was sick later (hence the one star). The floor was filthy, Seriously, the worst part was when we were told they were closing, sodas were shut down, and we were basically escorted out.  Getting belted in the parking lot, we noticed that the official smoke break began almost precisely 30 seconds after the doors were locked.  Obviously their paying customers are their priority.

Stand out dishes:

-Chorizo Sausage (my favorite dish)
-Jamon Serrano
-Carne Asada***
-The Flan***

*** only dishes my gf liked

""Papas Fritas"" was terrible, extremely salty and the dips were crap. But I told them I didn't like it and they replaced it with something else no problem.

We also ordered Sangria which was $40 for a carafe and it was good, but not the best I've ever had.  Other dishes were all middle of the road in terms fo flavor/value/etc.

I am a big fan of small plate/tapas style dining so I enjoyed the restaurant more than my gf but she would prob give this place a 2.5 star rating.

33,533,5.0,"My girlfriend and I went to Las Vegas last weekend for her birthday. As soon as we got to our room in the Monte Carlo, we naturally began searching Yelp for nearby restaurants. When we found out that one of our favorite Food Network Chefs, Bobby Flay, had a restaurant at Caesar's Palace, it instantly shot to the top of our list. 

We went to Mesa Grill for our last night, after going to Wolfgang Puck's, Lupo and Emeril Lagasse's Table Ten the nights before. The location was very convenient since Caesar's Palace is in the middle of the strip and the restaurant itself was absolutely gorgeous, very clean and modern. Everything you could possibly want for a classy Las Vegas experience. 

Personally I still had some doubts because Tex Mex is not my girlfriend's or my favorite type of cuisine, we never seek it out, but I would say I don't have much knowledge about it either. I didn't find the whole idea of Tex Mex too appealing.

I started getting even more concerned when I found the wait staff to be a little pretentious and more than a little snooty. Our main waiter in particular made me feel like we didn't belong since we're a young couple blowing all our money on this short getaway and not some rich established older people who can really afford to got to a place like this without worrying about making rent. Anyway he seemed rather annoyed at our amateur etiquette overall ignorance regarding such extravagance. But I think we won him over with our charm by the end.

The man who took our cocktail orders was by far the best, giving us all kinds of knowledge about the menu, making friendly conversation, sharing his personal preferences and just really making time to stop by a few times just so see how our drink experience specifically was going. The drinks were absolutely delicious.

Be excited about some pretty good free bread to help prepare you for the journey ahead. The bread grew on me as I ate more, but it was nothing to

We actually tried to save money by getting two appetizers, the Tiger Shrimp Tamale and Blue Corn Pancake, and only getting one entree, the Chile Relleno (one of my favorite dishes in life that was conveniently the most inexpensive entree on the menu). But when we tasted the appetizers, we instantly ordered another Entree, the Pork Tenderloin. The Tiger Shrimp Tamale especially was like tasting heaven. It the shrimp was zesty and bold pairing perfectly with the creamy garlic sauce. The texture of the tamale was very pleasing and the consistency  was tender, but still substantial. The Blue Corn Pancake was also delicious, the flavor was more simple, the duck was very juicy and was smothered in a succulent dark, deep, rich, velvety sauce. It was very aromatic, just a truly seductive dish.

The Chile Relleno had the most stunning presentation in my opinion. The cornmeal crust is that perfect amount of golden crisp, not oily. It's satisfying cracking it open like Creme Brulee and unleashing the cheezy melty, spicy explosion within. There are so many textural layers that make the experience of eating it so dynamic and just adds to the diversity of flavor. I've never had anything like it; by far one of the best dishes I've ever tasted in my entire life. It was like eating art.

The Pork Tenderloin was also breathtaking to look at, and my girlfriend would say it was the prettiest presentation, but we would both agree it was the best dish of the whole meal. I never knew that meat could be prepared in such a way where every nuance, every single note of flavor possible to achieve in the universe can sing in harmony together so immaculately. Every single flavor that has ever excited my taste buds came flooding back and brought back friends I never knew existed and we danced, danced, danced! Pure ecstasy. After that is kind of a blur. All I know is that I had eaten the best thing I have ever tasted.

And that wasn't even the end. We were so drunk on the pleasures of food and drink that we ordered dessert, the Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. The coconut shone throughout the dish, the cake was incredibly moist, the icing was soft and delicate and the Crème Anglaise just took the cake to another level of decadence. 

Overall the meal was one of the best in my whole life. The experience was also one of the best in my entire life, but I wouldn't call the restaurant experience perfect because of the service. In general Las Vegas service lacks in attitude. They do all the right things technically, but their attitude, personality, and what they say always leaves a lot to be desired. There's is rarely genuine friendly service and this restaurant, sadly was no exception in that area. But I still give the restaurant five stars for just being so breathtakingly delicious, the restaurant's atmosphere was beautiful and clean, and the service was still professional, fast and insanely efficient (when we ordered another entree, they still came out at the same time only minutes after we told them). Yes, go here! The end.",2013-09-16 02:42:03

We were incredibly happy with our purchase. As first time homebuyers and moving from out of state we were literally and mentally in new territory. His team walked us through every step of the process and we were able to get something great for our growing family within our budget in such a competitive market.

What really stood out was how the sale of our home went. We had already made a few minor upgrades to the property, but when it came time to sell, Bill gave us a few pointers to polish up the place. Using all of his recommended vendors, we were able to accomplish this in a short time and for low cost. He appropriately read the market and priced our home reasonably, and we ended up selling our home within a few days and walked away with an extra $30,000 cash in our pockets.

The Combo Pan Roast at Palace Station.

The ever so rude Gemma made little comments like ""oh like we're wine tasting here"" or when I told her that the three different sodas I tried were all flat that id prefer a bottled soda she said, ""so I wasted a cup."" Really unnecessary. First of, the cup didn't come out of her pocket. Second I told her prior to purchasing it that I wanted to try the drinks, so it's not my fault she grabbed a large cup already. 

The previous night my father in law purchased food and the food tasted like it has been sitting all day and was never replenished. The breading on the walnut prawns were chewy and not crispy anymore and the veggies were soggy. 

I won't be returning to this location ever and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Not even for a drink. Two days in a row the drinks were flat. Small portions with old tasting food. No thanks.",2016-04-26 03:42:54

1394,320,4.0,"Beerbistro was conveniently located to our hotel in Toronto and made a nice impression on us when we stepped in for dinner on a Saturday night. The dining room area felt really open despite the amount of tables in a relatively small foot print and the decor was very comfortable, darkly lit and modern. Very much my taste. Upscale Belgian beer themed bistro is what I would call it (shocking based on the name right?) and the food and drink definitely reflected that. The two ladies got samplers of 3 different draft beers that had plenty of quantity and at a very fair price. I was a bit disappointed they didn't carry any craft sodas since I don't drink at all and I find it a nice feature in a lot of high quality restaurants/beer joints. 

We went with the special of the night which was roasted suckling pig accompanied with mushrooms and house made chips and we grabbed a side of their fries as well. The pork was amazingly tender which we expected and offered a pleasant sweetness that paired well the salty mushrooms and chips. It didn't have the punch I've grown accustomed to with the roasted pork I get from Dominican and Puerto Rican establishments but nice in it's own right. Chips were top notch crispy and seasoned well with rosemary and the right amount. The definitive highlight of the meal was the fries cooked in beef and duck fat. We loved the fresh cut, skin on fries that were crispy and darkly flavoured in the best possible way with creamy interiors that showed off their skill at frying. Both the house made mayo and ketchup were tasty and that is coming from someone that hates mayo in general. Truthfully, I stayed toward the ketchup and the drippings from our main course but the mayo was significantly better than the jarred stuff.

I sampled our dining companions mussel dishes and both were very solid. The Thai broth was spicy and well seasoned with cocount and lemongrass and the New England style was decent if not quite up to the level of the Thai version. Mussels in both cases were cooked well with no signs of grit. A little bit pricey but plenty in each serving to be satisfied.",2013-01-11 17:47:27

I've tried multiple items with everything always being so tasty, however I do remember last year when I came I tried the veggie paella and it was not delicious. But again, paella is supposed to have seafood and meat, so that was a lack of judgment on my vegetarian friend who ordered it. So I forgive Firefly for that one and blame my friend. Ok back to last week. I ordered the clams, and it was so tasty my mouth is watering just thinking of it. Steamed to perfection and soaked in a broth with chorizo. Simply amazing. Roasted veggies were also amazing, as well as the pasta bowls. Our table ordered 3 of them and everyone who tasted it was in awe. However, it's alot of pasta; I don't think we even finished 1/2 of each one of the orders.

540,281,5.0,"I try to approach food reviews with a bowl full of practicality.  After all, it's just food right?  Someone makes it for you.  You eat it.  It goes to your stomach and you get full.  The collection of tastes, regardless of magnificence, are quickly filed into your culinary memory shortly after you pay and go on your merry way, reserving a moment to determine the probability of your return.
  
Café Monarch is a place where you can go to eat.   A restaurant by definition.   But to simply lump it into that broad classification is criminal.  Mind you, I despise flowery, over-hyped statements seemingly assigned to all things food (and wine) but this place is so much more than a restaurant.  It left me  desperately trying to grasp and hold the sensations of food, wine, atmosphere, music, service, comfort and how they all seemed to work in harmony to make our visit remarkable.   I'm a practical man and mostly grown up.  I try not to get caught up in hype or revel in the splendor of things like froe gras and Manila clam chowder or something called a Winter Salad which were all among best things I've ever put in my mouth.  But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.  

You will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.  

The lofty recommendation to visit Café Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression.",2017-01-27 20:52:48

I was happy that there was a sizable crowd when I arrived at 9 PM on a Wednesday. God bless late night eateries. And super god bless late night eateries that just so happen to also be breweries- YES!

5 stars for ambience! How in the world did they turn that unassuming, bland strip-mall location into something wonderful with great character?! It reminds me of the Vig uptown and the Yard. The design is more creative than the other two locations, and much larger. Also, as an ex-Boing employee, I appreciate the giant helicopter blade fans!

Of course, as the place just opened, there are still a lot of kinks to work out. I had been hearing rumblings in my neighborhood about warm beer, messed up orders, and bad service. My husband and I ended up experiencing some of that as well. I ordered the Summertime Cocktail, a muddled basil drink, and they forgot the the basil! Maybe that's karma for not ordering beer at a brewery? My waiter was nice of course and brought out a new one. Our table took ""wobbly"" to a new dimension. It was as if it was missing a leg entirely. It was a good laugh though, it almost felt like we were being set up on a hidden camera show.

My husband, who has the largest appetite of anyone we've ever met, ordered the diablo burger and only ate half! Good value. I got the blackened salmon tacos. Salmon is not normally my favorite fish for tacos, however, this really worked! The seasoning and flavor was nice. This too was a hardy portion for fish tacos. My only complaint was the under-seasoned, very soggy coleslaw. I'm guessing everything will vastly improve in the coming months.

I've definitely had worse experiences at newly opened restaurants (eg: the opening of Pomo at Gainey Ranch, sheer disaster, twice.)

Came here on a Saturday at 2PM to grab a quick late lunch. The restaurant was mostly empty with at least half the tables empty.  Two parties in front of us and the hostess took about 10 minutes to seat us.  She did not give us a food menu.  She was wearing thigh high boots which looked hard to walk in and a spaghetti strap low-cut tank top, which is consistent with another Yelp review that also pointed out another unprofessional outfit worn by the hostess.

Our server was friendly enough, but very slow.  He never refilled my water and never came back to check on us after our food came.  A different server brought our food.  The food took 20-30 minutes to arrive.

I asked to speak to the manager and he apologized and offered us free dessert.  We declined as we were already in a rush and he gave us a coupon for $10 off or a free entree.  Took some more time for us to get the bill (i.e. the service did not improve after my complaint) and the server told us we couldn't even use the coupon! 

Skip:
- Sushi rolls here are anorexic.  Tempura shrimp roll literally has one shrimp in it and is the smallest sushi roll I have ever seen.  Priced at $10, this is a rip off.

The course starts with a small salad with a delicious peanut based dressing. Next comes the vegetable plate which includes carrots, bamboo shoots, tofu and tofu noodles.  

Next comes the entree.  I almost always order the Jack Beef Shabu Shabu but they offer Sukiyaki and have shrimp, chicken and pork as well.  The Shabu Shabu comes with rice and three dipping sauces (spicy, sesame peanut and ponzu)  The night ends with a perfect scoop of ice cream.

I have tried other Shabu Shabu restaurants in town and have not found any others that compare in taste and service as Shabu Shabu Paradise. I will continue to come here and introduce others to it!",2009-03-03 16:38:36
875,167,5.0,"First off: I LOVE THIS PLACE!  This place is like family to me and I'll go here for as long as they are in business. Perfect for Indian imported groceries or if you're hungry and you don't feel like cooking, you can dine in or take out delicious meals. 

My favorites: 
Butter Chicken- The chicken is tender, juicy, and it soaks up the color from all the spices and flavors it gets marinated in. The sauce is perfect!

Chicken or Lamb Vindaloo- I've had both. I prefer extra spicy foods. If you like it hot and spicy, I suggest you request them to make it extra spicy for you. It is a hot lava heaven of flavors. The potatoes resemble embers because of spices and the dark red color of the sauce. It's awesome!

Aloo gobi- if you're wanting more of a spiced veggie dish, the cauliflower/potato combo is flavorful, it has a slight little kick of heat.

Gobi 65- The cauliflower dumplings entree. WOW! It's a mild vegetarian dish, but it is warm and comforting. The cauliflower dumplings are in a subtly spiced yogurt gravy, and the best way I can describe it is like India's version of an alfredo sauce with cauliflower. I highly recommend it, it's so good!

Samosas-  Great vegetable samosas! The filling is balanced with the holy trinity of Indian spices like curry, cumin, and coriander. There are even bits of cilantro in it as well. You can never go wrong to order these as a snack or to add to your meal.

Best garlic Naan too, perfect texture and fresh! 

Last but not least, THE BEST EVER!!!
Fresh Pickled Lemon/ Lemon Chutney- This deserves a mention. I've been told these lemons are fresh from the family lemon tree, it's a family recipe. Grandpa Singh won't teach me how to make my own, so I have to come here and ask them for large containers of it or bring a jar because they are the BEST and no other Indian restaurant has this, so it's a rare treasure. LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! Best lemon chutney you will ever find in Arizona! 

In conclusion, I love this place! I love the people! I've tried a few other Indian restaurants and most of them don't even compare. There are plenty of other items to choose from on the menu. This place never disappoints me and it deserves a higher rating!",2017-03-15 03:21:12

49,188,1.0,"TheHotel should be more appropriately named TheWorstHotel...truly. I travel to Vegas frequently and Mandalay Bay is one of my go-to hotels--that is, until now. I'm currently here for the UFC Fight Night and I booked my room months ago. I booked two nights at the Mandalay Bay through a promotion for their Great Suite Room, and I was pumped. Upon arrival however, the front desk notified me that the suite was no longer available and that I would actually be enjoying a room in TheHotel tower. Now, I understand occupancy and that sometimes room availability can change....but to move me to a completely different hotel?

Anyway, we trekked across Mandalay and finally got to our room on the 3rd floor--and were appalled. First off, it is the smallest room I have ever seen in Vegas, and WAY smaller than even the standard rooms in the Mandalay tower. The view is awful (see photo). There is zero soundproofing. The TV is a boob tube, seriously. And the room is downright filthy. Stains everywhere, bugs, etc. I called the front desk and they offered no assistance, saying there was nothing they could do. I toughed it out last night, and woke up this morning to call again--but I was put on hold for 20 minutes and they never picked up. Unreal.

(Update on 2/24) The story gets better though. The woman at the front desk at check-out asked how my stay was, and I told her the truth. She didn't seem to care in the least, and simply responded by saying, ""Hopefully your experience will be better next time"". HA! There won't be a next time. And then she massively overcharged me - nearly doubling the amount that I actually owed. Completely unacceptable. 
This is not at all the experience I was hoping for. I will not be staying at Mandalay ever again. Horrible customer service and horrible hotel!",2014-02-22 20:02:11

256,413,3.0,"Food: Overall, the food is tasty, but the some of the items are overcooked or dry. An example meat that was overcooked was the Korean dry ribs. The nice thing about water is that they had a nice glass water bottle on the table for you to use and refill your glass at your own leisure.  I would have liked more food with the plastic syringe containing a syrup or sauce, but that's because I like fun food. :) There were only two that had them. The small cheese platter was delectable. I love how the food was small and cutely presented. The stirfry vegetables (Asian) was very chewy and overcooked. They should have pruned the vegetables, leaving the parts that were still fresh and cut them into more bite sized pieces. Yes, you can cut it, but it was so chewy that cutting it with the provided knife was not useful. I also loved the gelato section. I got the Thai tea gelato and it tasted heavenly. The deep fried tofu was so dry but the peanut sauce was yummy. My three favorite dishes were the bacon and tomato salad with candied bacon, the strawberry shortcake, and the best one, the crostini with grilled peach on top (DELICIOUS). I  ended up eating a lot because I was trying all sorts of things, but it was a fun experience. The best food is at the dessert and cold food sections for me.

Atmosphere: This place is beautifully decorated with a modern feel. It is located at the Cosmopolitan which has a modern interior too. We had dinner there on Wednesday night, so there was no line. Since there wasn't a lot of people there, we had a nice quiet dinner.

Service: For a place that charges me more than $30 a person ($34.99 to be exact for a Wednesday night), I expect the service to be more attentive/quick. Our table for two did not have room for the plates we were actively eating plus the plates we were finished using. I expected them to sweep in and remove the plates. They were rather slow and took their time doing so.

Bottom line: I give this buffet a 3.5 but am rounding down to 3 after having gone to the Bacchanal Buffet. :) You are welcome to check out my review of the Bacchanal Buffet on yelp too.",2012-09-20 15:27:36

I don't understand how people say the bouncers are rude, I have NEVER had an issue getting into this club.  

The main floor and the outside area is the best.  There are two other rooms, the library and the boombox room, which are cool if you like hip hop or want something other than EDM.  

The EDM scene here is the best that you can get in the US, even better than Hollywood (and I'm from LA).  THe main floor is cool because you really can get super close to famous internationally renowned djs. You may even get to meet them ;).  It's the exact same with the Day Club, you get as close as 5 feet from the djs.  The pool party is classy, but fun and with good music, it really does not get any better.

The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey.

1605,489,4.0,"I wished upon a star that I would have been impressed even more with Fleur de Lys, but the touch and go execution and less than five star caliber service made this Top Chef Masters Vegas outpost fall short of a fifth.

For a fancy French restaurant, I was impressed with the understated elegance of the space.  Gorgeous floor to ceiling curtains add a soft contrast to the rose adorned stone wall.  The wine cellar on the second floor is definitely eye catching, but again, nothing over the top.  I wasn't a huge fan of the narrow, cramped lounge area in the front where we were asked to wait for our table.  The ""patio"" bar seating area outside the restaurant is less than stellar unless you like people walking up to your table to read the menu that's right in front of your table.  Past 10pm, you can hear the live band playing from across the hall, which I imagine can get a little annoying if you're there for an intimate dinner.

The four course tasting menu certainly had its highlights.  The truffled onion soup is the star of the tasting menu.  This is a masterfully executed dish - this is coming from a guy who's not a huge fan of onions either.  Flavors are delicately balanced.  Five stars.  I'm a short ribs fanatic and I have to admit I was not very impressed with my dish. The potato and carrot puree was incredible, but the short ribs was a bit tough and stringy on the outside - not fork tender.  I'd say 3.5 stars.  My friends ordered souffle - top drawer.  The salted fondit chocolate cake and popcorn ice cream was intriguing - if you like salty sweet flavors combined together.  On average, the food was 4 stars,

The execution of the dishes and particularly the service is where Fleur de Lys falls short of its five star reputation.  My friend's bacon wrapped seabass was cold and so she waited while we finished our second course before her replacement dish came out.  I understand these things happen, but this is a JV mistake at a varsity level restaurant.  Some of my fellow yelpers commented on the lackluster service.  We definitely felt that.  Beautifully prepared plates were destroyed due to poor presentation by the servers.  Dishes were nearly dropped.  Service felt too clinical, lacking in any warmth.  The bright star of course was the sommelier who offered a great wine pick from the menu.  Otherwise, I'd rate the service a 3.

For the most accurate gauge, I'd say the original SF outpost for a taste of Fleur de Lys' true potential.  Vegas outpost isn't bad at all, but it's not five star worthy in my book.",2010-02-02 07:00:49

This place runs expensive, and it took a long time to get served due to seemingly failing to have a host on staff from the direction we came in (later on, after they held my left-behind credit card kindly for me and when I returned for it, I realized the host dwells in a different location to enter in). Looking for a really cheap meal, we had the volcano nachos which was just such an excessive amount of food, probably fit for 5 people, so make sure you bring at least 3 people or the prices won't make sense. You're supposed to get drinks here, but their items seemed pricey so we skipped the drinks. Am I missing something about the Jimmy Buffett dynasty that makes the menu so expensive? I guess you're supposed to buy the drinks so that you can eat that quantity of food huh? 
Inside there is non-stop video footage of the fun-times man himself on his namesake island in Florida...all around a good place to hang if this kind of thing makes you nostalgic, not really my kind of thing, but I won't knock it for that.

53,515,3.0,"DAYCLUB:  (I have a nightclub review below too)

Soooo I am directly comparing Marquee Dayclub with Encore Beach, and for me, Encore Beach definitely wins.  The problem with Marquee Dayclub is that the pool just isn't really conducive to meeting people very easily, and there's only 1 pool.  There IS another small pool I guess, but it's in this VIP area and nobody was in it.  I'm sure that in the middle of summer this place is more hopping, but it's the end of April and it was a Sunday, so maybe it was slow for those reasons.  

On the plus side, there were free drinks for girls from 1pm-2pm, so that was nice.  But it didn't include fun drinks, just well drinks... at least they're trying to get chicks drunk.  I did like all of the bartenders though, they are super nice!

The VIP areas they had aren't really that close to the pool, so that was kinda lame.  And the people there just weren't as hot as I was expecting.  I think I'm just being picky, plus my past experiences at Encore Beach were just better than here.  Overall I wouldn't say don't go....but I would say to try Encore Beach first....

Beware, don't order rice because they make you eat a big bowl of fried rice that has maybe one pea in it, with no eggs or pay full price. I have a few problems with this: 1. The fried rice was horrible. 2. I would never pay for a bowl of fried rice that bad! 3. I would rather get a 13 dollar roll of the regular menu and eat it all than eat any of their rolls on the all you can eat menu. Unless their regular menu is just as bad. 4. Their all you can eat rolls are sorry. Really pathetic for a sushi role. I've been to many all you can eat sushi places that were way way better. If you can't afford to make a decent all you can eat, then don't have an all you can eat!!!!! It was honestly an all you can eat crappy fried rice bowl rather than an all you can eat sushi. Cocktails were good, hence the one star.",2018-01-05 21:26:03
690,319,1.0,"One of the worst taco shops I've ever been to- definitely the worst in Phoenix. Their dry and bland burritos lacked fresh authentic ingredients and were replaced by an excess of what tasted like unseasoned beans straight out of the can. The disappointingly small portions of rice and beans would have usually bothered me but after one bite the rest ended up in the trash anyway. 

The service was terrible- and we got it to go! They confused our order, couldn't remember which burrito was which, and while we were waiting we couldn't help but notice how dirty the silverware was on their appropriate abundance of unoccupied dining tables. 

A must skip restaurant in a market that's  abundant with stellar Mexican food in every neighborhood.",2016-02-05 02:50:42

The bathroom was amazing with a huge tub, glass shower, two sinks, and LCD TV.  Oh yea, and of couse there is the toilet.  Durr.  The layout of the suite is perfect.  You walk in and there are two SUPER comfy beds with a big flat screen.  A few steps below is another section with a huge L shaped couch and another TV.  I also loved how you have a remote to draw the curtains and shades.  This is KEY when you are hungover in the morning and can't seem to get up.  One press of the button and the 11am sunlight streams into your bedroom and you can't help but wake up. :)

On top of the fabulous rooms, the hotel has so much to offer.  Fabulous shops, a fun gondola ride, and great restaurants.  I would definitely recommend staying at the Venetian.",2012-04-19 14:29:30

My husband had a chicken and sausage pasta dish - he especially loved the sausage and says he will order the sausage and peppers next time so he can have more sausage!

However, my trip to Rise & Shine a steak and egg place provided me with one of the best corned beef hash entrees I've ever had. The pulled corned beef had a great sear on it with a nice malliard browning along with some caramelized onions, red skin potatoes, and two eggs over easy and I was in corned beef nirvana.  The owners really spent some time perfecting this simple yet amazing dish.

She wouldn't talked to me, only shook her head yes or no. She only spoke when she felt like it.

856,890,4.0,"Somehow or another, I had never been to this tourist attraction at the Paris, but, having a coupon from a friend who had recently and previously been to Vegas, we were able to get one ticket  at full price in exchange for an additional one for free. This depends on the time of day you go, but if you choose night, then you're looking at a total of $23 for two originally priced tickets of  about $12. The reason the math still looks like its for two is because there is a ~$2.50 surcharge per ticket, which is  annoying. Its absolutely essential you get this deal, and if not, just wait until its available to scale this monument.
Speaking of scale, it's 1/2 scale of the original Parisian World Fair of 1889 entrance, making it around 500 feet high instead of the 1,050 feet of the original, but its still startling for its views at night. After you pay, you get your picture taken by a photographer upon a walkway that promenades across the Paris casino. You'll notice that the foundations of this tower are actually indoors and when you go up, you're outdoors with phenomenal vistas of the Bellagio (where you can watch the fountain shows if you're able to sit on some space circumventing the see-through safety fence). The Cosmo, Paris and even further hotels like the Aria and NYNY are easily seen at night.

1099,951,2.0,"I was actually pretty disappointed in this place. We had breakfast, so maybe that was the wrong move, because their deserts looked amazing. I am thinking if we went there for desert I would have been in love with the place.

Basically our breakfasts were just ok, the service was, blaaaa, ok, nothing exciting. 

What stood out to me is the lack of team work or caring at the front desk. Someone had broke a glass and so shards of glass were all over the front near the door and the check in stand. One of the 3 hostesses basically kicked some of the glass over to the hostess stand and that was about it, so everyone that walked in automatically walked into a pile of glass. 

I just kept watching and watching thinking a manager would do something when they came up. Nothing happened. So finally one of the servers (wait staff) walked by that had not been in the area for awhile. She saw the mess, looked around, kinda shook her head (you could tell she was thinking WTF), then ran off got a broom, dustpan, etc and cleaned it up. 

I was just so surprised that 3 hostesses and a manager stood around and did nothing but kick the big shards into a pile, then left it there. It was just amazing people were walking all over the glass.",2015-03-08 03:55:21
998,408,4.0,"Went to Vegas this past weekend and one of the highlights of the trip was hitting up this unnamed (yet not much of a secret) pizza joint in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Luckily, I've got a friend out there that my wife went to school with so we learned about it almost instantaneously. 

The walk up into this place is pretty impressive. The Cosmopolitan is actually one of the nicer hotels in Vegas, and you don't actually get forced in the casino the second you walk in. It definitely seems to cater to a 20 somethings crowd, which I think is very appealing for people that my age bracket, but I can imagine might be tedious for people that are a little bit older.

So, on to the pizza itself. The place is small and down a fairly long hallway. They've got some pinball machines and a counter where you order and pay. No seats, but there's a little lounge back out in the hotel, so it's really not  a big deal. Their pizza is greasy and has a good crust. 

It's fucking expensive. Seriously, I don't usually complain much about price with food, but $4 for a slice is absurd. David Chang isn't making my fucking pizza back there, and even if he was I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have the balls to overcharge on a slice. 

Bottom line, it's definitely good, and I'm sure it's absolutely fantastic if you're shit faced. It's worth probably once, but unless you're right in the area you shouldn't go out of your way.",2012-05-09 00:25:40

We all got enticed and tourist trapped by the more expensive and classy promise eatery on the big strip. If you're on a budget or is a smart and savvy eater. This place will be a  new eatin sensory haven for u! They have all your typical buffet varieties, and some not so typical dishes which I have'nt seen in other buffets. For example, they have Peking Duck breast that are the size of  my fist. A station which cater to the Hawaiian and Filipino patrons. I thought that was a very nice touch and a smart concept, considering the amount of Asians visitin and livin there. My overall experience eatin here would only sum it up in two words. Wow!!!! Wow!!!! If U don't mind comin down to old downtown Fremont area. The Garden Buffet will be the most excellent choice to dine at. The scrumptious variety of fresh dishes and the too cheap to almost noting entrance fee just make everyone feel like a winner by eatin here.

2046,904,3.0,"This was my 1st time visiting this salon I came in on a Saturday around 3:45. 

First impressions: Well as I walk in all the techs look up @ me but nobody says anything (awkward) I walk up to the counter and the lady closest to the desk asks "" can i help you"" and I tell her I just need a pedicure. Then I got the usual ""pick your color"".
 The place seems clean and orderly. The techs are in an array of work attire from business casual to I'm-headed-to-yoga RIGHT after work.

The experience: They had me in the chair soaking for 20 minutes before someone came to work on me, which I found a bit excessive. The massage chair is always a welcomed treat and their chairs were good no complaints there. Now I may be a little more particular because I'm a licensed cosmetologist and I know what, how, and where all the implements are supposed to be used and proper procedures. That being said the lady (who never introduced herself) barely did all the nail and cuticle prep, she seemed very rushed and just trying to get done. The massage was also  mediocre  and was more of a quick rub with no concern for the actual muscles in the feet and legs. I got the French manicure and I really liked it which I was happy about because the polish is one of the most important parts of the pedi. 

The end: Paid $27 ($22 reg pedi + $5 french)  for this experience so I won't complain there but I will be visiting other spots in my area to compare. Not so sure if I'll be back. .",2015-08-01 23:52:32
1544,415,5.0,"What an absolute delight! 

Stepping into the tiny grocery/cafe, i was washed in delicious smells of curry and every imaginable spice. My dad chose this place for dinner as it conveniently sells leg of lamb (our family's traditional Christmas eve main course). 

Myself, my dad & mom, my sister and 7-year old niece found a relatively comfortable table and set up shop. While we waited for menus, my sister & I eagerly gazed at the shelves of exotic foods just a few paces away. After selecting a wide variety of menu items, my sister and I bolted for the grocery area while my dad entertained my niece. 

My sister found some curry pastes and I goggled at the biryani rice mix, the watermelon jam, and the super-cheap olive oil. I love places like this! 

Our meal came quite quickly, so we barely made it through the 3 small aisles. We rushed back to the table to dig in. 

I ordered a gyro on the side to keep for lunch the next day (was it really $3.50 for this massive thing??) My mom ordered a falafel sandwich (she's a vegetarian most of the time), dad started in on his shwarma sandwich (the beef was shredded and tasted like machaca; very flavorful!). My niece is a picky eater but our server accommodated and instructed the kitchen to create a ""chicken-on-a-stick."" She had a disbelieving, almost grossed-out, expression on her face when it was placed before her (it was basted in a mild yellow curry). After trying the meat, she devoured most of it (we were SO proud!). 

The piece d' resistance was the combo platter that my sis & I shared. Gyro meat with the lovely cucumber sauce, 2 falafel (some of the best I've ever had, light, fluffy, melt-in-your mouth), a huge serving of taboli (sp?) salad, 2 warm dolmas (delicious!), an odd little tasty cake (i know it has a name but I'm too lazy to search for it) that had seasoned ground beef sandwich between layers of a slightly sweet wheat cake. Finally, my favorite, the deep fried beef eggroll. The meat was amazingly seasoned but the wrapping was that sweet dough. My sister described it as ""pumpkin pie except with beef."" Weird combo, but Divine!!!

This place is fantastic! Sweet and Savory Crepes!? Unbelievable! I think the price is just right, because it is a specialty dish so I don't have any problem paying the $7 for an amazing crepe. The First Time dessert crepe is to die for, as well as the Chicken Griddle.

Be sure to try one of the Grown Up Sodas they have in the fridge. I spoke to the owner about them and he just got them and they are fantastic! (And I'm not really a soda kinda guy)

924,177,1.0,"I'm here to comment on the conduct of one of the tour leaders taking a group of what appeared to be mainly senior citizens on a tour through Red Rock Canyon Park today.  Their convoy pulled up into the farthest parking lot at the second parking area after you enter the park. The problem was they pulled up on to the side of the walkway right behind parked cars.  That is where my experience begins.  I was with my family and we were in the process of backing out with old people in scooters right behind our car.  It was not safe to do so but tour leader #1 encouraged me to do so.  After successfully backing out I proceeded up the narrow lane created by the convoy parked unsafely on the right of us and the series of parked cars on the left. The left hand turn I have to make is particularly narrow due to the tour leaders scooter parked in the front of the convoy.  Tour leader #2 is in front of my car and recognizes the situation he has created for me.  Rather than get in his scooter and move out of the way he proceeds to gesture his hands and arms wildly assuming the role of traffic cop.  I was distracted by what amounted to me to be an unrequested buffoon show.  As my first pass was unsuccessful rather than allowing me the opportunity to correct my angle myself this buffoon proceeds to come to my drivers side window AND PUT HIS HANDS ON MY STEERING WHEEL....again I did not request his help in any way shape or form.  Now he is asking me to move my vehicle as he commandeers the steering wheel to correct my angle.  My family is looking on with startled discomfort as though to think whats this buffoon going to do next?  He created a highly unsafe situation as a result of his buffoonery...

As I was leaving this buffoon decides to save his own face and announce to the convoy of disbelieving tourists that ""He Cant Drive"".... are you kidding me?  You come into my family and my life unwelcomed in the most buffoonish way, create a buffoonish situation and now try to launch a buffoonish insult to your paying customers?

I have not taken this tour would not recommend it based on my peripheral experience and would certainly caution anyone to place there lives in the hands of a clear buffoon tourist leader.  Ruined what was otherwise a lovely family day out.",2017-11-18 21:07:11
601,333,4.0,"Watching a Thunder from Down Under show for the first time feels like an initiation.  Like discovering a secret place where it's socially acceptable for everyday women to completely lose their minds.

I was planning on staying coherent enough to write an anthropological study on this phenomenon, but it was too powerful even for me.  Before I knew it, I, too, was screaming giddily and spilling my vodka cranberry on the poor lady next to me.

In my addled state of mind, I couldn't tell you too many details about the show itself.  It's basically a mix of acts.  Group dances, one-person dances, bits where the host calls people on stage.  The dances usually end with a random audience member chosen and brought up on stage for some very classy second-base fondling.  The music and costumes are gloriously cheesy (""Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy,"" natch).  The performers don't stick to the stage, so don't be surprised if a sweaty buff man in kneepads jumps up onto your table and gyrates his speedo in your face.  I mean, maybe that doesn't surprise you anyway, but just a heads-up.

Though I didn't find the show particularly titillating, the big emotional impact came from being surrounded by a vortex of screaming women and from being in close proximity to really hot, shirtless guys.  There was also the mixture of abject horror and fascination that came with watching a grandmother who looked like Mrs. Doubtfire eagerly reaching into a guy's leather pants and stroking him.  I don't know about you, but that's not something I get to see every day.  

If you go with a group of your spunkiest friends, the fun increases exponentially.  I recommend that you get liquored up beforehand, as the drinks in the theater are overpriced and a bit slow in coming (like your mum).     

There's no stuffing of cash into G-strings, but the performers take photos after the show for $20 (cash).  You should do this, because you are creepy like me. 

The shirtless guy taking my money: What's your name?  
Me: Rebecca.
Shirtless guy: Oh.  That's Bicky.  We'd call you Bicky in Australia.
Me: Yes.  Yes, sir.
Shirtless guy: (leading me to the sofa) Everyone, this is Bicky.

Then followed an odd moment when I realized just how incredibly sweaty these men get.  They pulled me down on their laps (I swear) and they were soaked.  I almost slid off.  There were towels piled under the sofa.  Luckily I know the butterfly stroke and was able to get out of there.  

P.S.  The current performers are a lot better-looking than the ones on the posters and promotional materials, some of which look to be from 1998.  Don't worry, ladies.  The new ones look nothing like the curly-haired guy from Color Me Badd.",2013-08-07 17:03:39

856,846,3.0,"Kind of the -Days Inn- of the strip. If I were to suddenly polka dot, nay, spray can paint you with random epithets, I'd say this place is family oriented, underwhelming in the gaming area department, corporate-feeling, astonishingly affordable for the location and unmemorable compared to what you can possibly spoil yourself with on other parts of the strip.

Parking here kind of blows. They make you feel second rate from the get-go. You can self-park and when you get to the elevator, you have to walk through Paris (not a bad thing really, but time consuming) to get to the Bally's registration area, which always seems to have long queues. 

We stayed in the newly renovated North Tower, deluxe room. Averaging $77 a night for Monday and Tuesday nights, I feel like the hotel could have averaged $30 a night had we stayed longer. The luck I had in Vegas made me rue the day a bit.

That said, the deluxe room just seemed to lack the amenities I had taken for granted as a guest at Mandalay Bay and the Palms in the past. No refrigerator, big boxy television, a tub for a bath and not even a couch to lay down on. The beds DO make up for it and are rather comfortable and spic 'n' span clean.

Stay here if you'll need more gambling money. But gamble elsewhere. Anywhere elsewhere.",2011-04-22 06:38:32
1018,731,5.0,I have been here several times over the last month. Breakfast and Dinner. I have to say this is one of my favorite spots for breakfast. You can sit on the patio and get a great view of the Boulevard and people watch. You get a gorgeous view of the Bellaigo fountains when they are running dinner time is great for that. So onto the food. The bananas foster waffle is light and delicious. I must get this everytime now. The spinach and goat cheese omlette was fluffy and cooked to perfection.  I love crepes but I really didn't like the pancakes they were nice and light just needed a little sweetness in the batter for my taste. I can see how many would like them.  The fruit bouquet is great to share and very fresh. Coffee is good and they keep it flowing. Date glazed bacon a must if you like bacon. My hubby got the corned beef hash and they use nice big pieces of freshly cooked corned beef it was very good and top quality not greasy. The muffins are great as well. I got the beef bourg for dinner it has excellent flavor. Service has been great on each visit as well.

I've tried multiple items with everything always being so tasty, however I do remember last year when I came I tried the veggie paella and it was not delicious. But again, paella is supposed to have seafood and meat, so that was a lack of judgment on my vegetarian friend who ordered it. So I forgive Firefly for that one and blame my friend. Ok back to last week. I ordered the clams, and it was so tasty my mouth is watering just thinking of it. Steamed to perfection and soaked in a broth with chorizo. Simply amazing. Roasted veggies were also amazing, as well as the pasta bowls. Our table ordered 3 of them and everyone who tasted it was in awe. However, it's alot of pasta; I don't think we even finished 1/2 of each one of the orders.

What earns this shop a 5 star rating above and beyond the food, was the service.  The shop owner, Theo, greeted me warmly upon entering and walked me through the menu, made suggestions, and even shared his favorite menu item.  What a great guy!  No wonder you guys have been so successful.  Overall, great experience and I'll most definitely be back.

-  Wait time was reasonable.
-  Atmosphere was urban and fun
-  food was very good.  The Cold Brown and Chicken BU were both excellent and I'd easily order both again.  The chicken sandwich had a unique batter on it that was very different from your shake shacks, and chic fill a's of the world.
- The house chips were simple, but tasty (jalapeño and salt & pepper were both great)

There's not much I can say negative about this place, but in the spirit of objectivity and balance, if I were to advise them on anything, I might suggest a slightly larger chip portion size, which felt a little skimpy.

Service far from memorable. The host was not inviting - too casual and doing her business I guess. She seemed to be busy enjoying her cup of Starbucks on Saturday afternoon.  Our server with very dry attitude. Never suggested any specials whatsoever. 
The cob salad too small for $15.50 considering that some of the spinach were not fresh.  I asked to add the blue cheese on the side but they add it in the salad anyways.  The chicken wings were very small like any other bird but not chicken. We mentioned to the waiter that  the wings were too hot fir our taste. He offered ranch to add to the wings.  Really?  We are paying $10.50 for mini wings and two sticks of carrots and two sticks of celery.  Never offered an alternative.  Not choice but eat the wings.

Breads - They give you a basket with a couple different types of bread. Nice! Something for everyone. The best of the bunch was the jalapeno cheese bread. LOVED it. Cornbread really was very crumbly, and it was also slightly salty, which was odd. I like my cornbread sweet, thanks.

Blue Corn Pancake - Eh. Thought the sauce was a little weird....

Tiger Prawn Tamale - Oh man was that delicious. And the corn was so yummy, but it's really filling so be careful with that one as an appetizer.

Sophie's salad - Great! I love fruity dressings and cheese.

Crab pancakes - You certainly do get a lot of crab, but I wasn't wowed by it. Very filling.

Pork tenderloin - I don't know if it was supposed to be cold, but I don't like my meat cold unless it is sandwich ""meat"". Had an interesting flavor, but eh.

Cuban burger - SOOOOO GOOOOOOOD. I don't even like mustard (I told the waiter no dijon, and he said that was the one thing they couldn't take out...) but man was that burger good. I didn't even really taste the dijon.

Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash - Okay, so I don't know if it's just me, but when I see ""hash"" I think like hash browns or maybe some sort of sweet potato fries... What we got was more like ""mash,"" and it was actually mixed in with the chicken.  Kind of gross in my opinion.  Really sweet, not spicy at all.

Coconut layer cake - TO DIE FOR. So moist and delicious. And you get a gigantic slice. Enough for two or more people depending on how full you are.

Chocolate creme brulee with blueberry compote - OMNOMNOMNOM.  The chocolate at the bottom of the creme brulee really makes it even better.",2010-08-30 06:11:12

The waitstaff here was spot on, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was beautiful...felt like you were in a little eatery in Italy. The prices are right...you get a good size portion - didn't order any appetizer...although they did bring out this very fresh, warm bread...which hit the spot! Was so hungry! 

the wine was brought out in a little glass canister, and was enough for two glasses.

729,56,4.0,"I've been in Phoenix for about 3 weeks now (relocating from So Cal) and have been very disappointed in the Mexican Restaurants thus far. A friend of mine suggested Carolina's. It's only 3 miles from my office so I gave it a shot for lunch. GLAD I DID! 

I went with my wife and a colleague who both verified my evaluation! We all 3 ordered different things. I'll speak for my chimichanga.... Lightly fried and full of white chicken meat. I also ordered some chips and salsa (extra) which seemed fresh as can be. I ordered 6 corn tortillas to go because i heard they were so good (made fresh daily). I had to try one (they were still warm). Delicious! 

Not the best Mexican food I've ever had but by far the best Mexican food thus far in Phoenix. You order and pay at the counter and your number is called within minutes. Fair prices, too. This place will be in my regular rotation for lunches going forward!",2011-08-23 03:43:20

1214,31,2.0,"Probably the WORST buffet in Las Vegas. This place makes the already not-so-great, Vegas buffet in Glendale, CA. look good.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafood-buffet-glendale#hrid:JnIwxV7PDcIRU7PhAETMrA) 

I bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is. 

The line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.

When you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees? 

I barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies. 

I will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again.",2012-06-26 19:10:08

Pizza seems like the only choice, so it was so great to find a real restaurant by such a great chef open late to serve hungry people. We attended a concert on a Monday and we didn't get out until very late and were needed to eat some food. This place did not disappoint. We got seated right away and our waiter was amazing. He was incredibly on point with the menu and able to answer any questions from our group. My husband and I shared a salad and a burger. I told the waiter that  we were sharing and they evenly split both items, which was really great. The Cesar salad was simple but the dressing was amazing and evenly coated the lettuce. It came with cherry tomatoes and unlike most restaurants that serve things that look like tomatoes but never actually tastes like them, these were amazing, they were sweet and actually tasted like a real tomato. The burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. It came with fries too which were great.Three of us all got  the same burger. One friend got a pepperoni pizza and was very pleased and someone got the crab cakes. Once the food arrived no one spoke, everyone amerced themselves in eating and everyone was incredibly pleased. there were several cocktails - two moscow mules and I had an amazing cocktail here is was a lima sour I believe and it was plum/lime inspired.

789,737,4.0,"The GF and I stayed here for a couple nights after spending Xmas with her family. A very pleasant experience!

We stayed in one of the new towers. I've heard the old towers aren't nearly as nice, but I wouldn't know. I do know the new towers are GREAT. I was immediately impressed by how clean everything looked when we came in, especially the carpet. Seriously, most hotel room carpets are pretty nasty. But not here. The sitting area was very spacious and comfortable (nice big sectional wraparound couch), with a room divider separating it from the sleeping area. The room divider had huge flat-panel TVs on each side of it, one facing the sitting area and one facing the bed. They're not intended to be used at the same time, because it's still just a single room. The only annoying thing is that they use the same kind of remote control...it happened more than once that we were in bed watching TV and turned it off to sleep, but pressing the power button caused the one on the other side of the divider to turn on. Not the end of the world, but a bit of a pain.

The bathroom...OMG. It was as big as my apartment! It really felt like a little taste of luxury just to take a shower! The bed was AMAZING. An entire person could disappear under that luxurious down-stuffed comforter.

Nice decor. We had a big picture of Debbie Harry in our room. I like the free music system that's installed in the wall.

Good valet service, no issues at all with check-in or check-out and the concierge was very helpful. I would have expected the casino floor at the Hard Rock Hotel to be extremely noisy, even by casino standards. It was actually much quieter than most casinos, which was a nice change of pace.

I can't review the pool/beach area and ""Rehab"" because we came during the winter, most of that area was closed off and I wasn't about to go swimming at the beach in 60-degree weather...but it looked pretty.

Overall a very good experience, as long as you don't mind being a few blocks away from The Strip.",2011-05-20 14:34:09

962,24,4.0,"I hate buffets. I almost never I try a buffet that is even remotely passable in terms of quality, taste and preparation. The Buffet at the Bellagio is one of those exceptions; in fact it by far surpasses any buffet I have ever found. 

Here you will find a huge selection of food, anything from beef, pork, lamb, seafood and even vegetarian. Everything I sampled would rival entrees from most any sit down restaurant you will find. For me the highlight was the Alaskan King Crab legs, they were perfectly cooked, large, meaty and pre-split. It's rare that I find crab of this quality. I find the prime rib equally prepared, cooked to a perfectly medium rare. The various pork and chicken dishes were excellent. Of the vegetable sides I sampled the mashed potatoes (real potatoes), green beans, corn, salad, etc., all were delicious. Of the few breads I sampled were also very good. In short this was a buffet that really was one of the best meals I had had in quite a while, I left satisfied and overstuffed. 

Now the bad, at just under $40 it's quite expensive. It's also a good idea to try and arrive just about opening, the lines can get quite long. Given the quality and variety of food it really isn't a bad deal in my view. Just make sure you're hungry when you go. For a buffet The Buffet it's as good as it gets.",2013-10-24 15:19:09
1021,352,2.0,"2.5-Stars is more than fair! But I am rounding down for this place. 

Had a night here and at first glance it's a pretty good looking place to stay. The decor is fresh, modern, and very tasteful. 

Kinda like a desert mirage it was all just in my imagination...

The check-in experience was very disappointing as they seemed confused on just about everything and how to process our stay. One manager was on a call with an angry guest-- that was clue #1. 

Besides the to be expected rank odor of stale cigarettes throughout the place, what I noticed almost immediately was the low grade materials and workmanship everywhere!!! 

The paper-thin walls are no joke! You can hear everything near, above, and below. Every voice, cough, grunt, and sound will be magnified in all directions. 

Then if you turn the A\C on in the room it will sound much like a freight train passing by...

While I am grateful there was a mattress cover on the bed, it felt like a heavy weight plastic bag used in a geriatric facility. Nothing like rolling over on plastic. 

Loved the style of the bathroom just wish the water pressure matched the strength of the design. 

Here's what I would leave you to consider-- it's cheap and fairly nice, just not as nice as it looks!! If you go to a Motel 6, you know exactly what to expect, however when you come here you may be dissatisfied once you realize everything you see is just too good to be true! 

If you're drunk and exhausted, you won't even notice the noise or cheap construction...

food:  4 stars good portion size. that's if you stick to anything ""american"".  Example was a friend ordered the Tandoori Chicken plate... well, there's nothing Tandoori about it.  The chicken looked like they came off the grill (which is not how tandoori's are done) and had some spices thrown on top of it.  She didn't like it.  the bback ribs were excellent however.  Again if you stick to the ""american"" grub you'll be fine.  Another friend ordered the rib eye medium-well, it was a bit over done.

atmosphere:  3 stars.  decent typical bar scene in a college town/business district.  nothing spectacular but then again, you wouldn't expect anything more or anything less.

service:  1 star.  we had an extremely rude server who gave us attitude as soon as we sat down.  it appeared he was not happy about having out-of-town business type people because as soon as we asked for separate checks, he threw an attitude and was quite rude.  rolled his eyes a couple times!!! he was ""special"" and if you do visit this joint and get Eric as ur server, look out!!!

This place could have been better but again, if you can look pass the annoyances and focus on the food, you'll definitely like this place.

When we arrived, we sighed:  There were tons of people outside, and we figured there would be a one hour wait.  To our delight, we saw that there were lovely family-style picnic benches outside where people were enjoying their breakfast in the winter Arizona sun, and there was only a 20 minute wait.

Once we sat down to eat, I noticed that the service was friendly and on-point, and Henhouse had some nice diner touches (coffee mugs that advertised local businesses, small town antique wall decor) but with fresh food and healthy options. The high ceilings also contributed to the feeling of space and relaxation, and our food was delivered quickly.  On the menu for this foodie with allergies:  Veggie skillet, hold the eggs and tomatoes, add some fresh slicked turkey. Plus, a cup of steel cut oats with both craisins and raisins, hold the sugar. YUM.  The potatoes are thinly sliced and pan-fried, and tasted too fresh to have come from a plastic bag.  Hubby had the two egg plate, and was delighted to learn that the bread came from a local bakery.  Indeed, the thick chunk of rye bread was beautifully marbled - none of that anemic sandwich bread for Henhouse.

I do dig this gem of a cafe in NoDa, but more for the atmosphere than the baked goods (which I think could use some more oomph). I love the quaint decor, the antique mismatched chairs and spread out feel and the art on the wall. Students studying, a couple playing boardgames, friends catching up - Good vibe. 

Coffee was good, thank goodness, I was dying for java. We sat outside in the atrium, sort of odd that they expand out because it doesn't seem a part of the cafe, but it's so quiet and open, I quite like that they have the space. We had a late lunch and ordered the ham and gruyere tartines. They were tasty, but too small!

Anyway, the main reason I went there was to check out the pastries since I needed dessert for a big family event that's coming up and had read so many rave reviews. The guy at the counter couldn't offer up any free samples (or a smile) but he did walk me through their wonderful looking array of baked goods to tell me what they had which was helpful. I was excited for the tasting and a bit sad that it didn't blow my mind.
I sampled:
Coconut macaroon - meh, a miss for me, I did not dig the sweetener/sugar that they used, I thought they were overpriced, and they were not at all reminiscent of the best macaroons I have ever had, in France. 
Mini berry tart - I wanted to love it, it looked so cute, and it wasn't even too sweet, but it wasn't memorable either.
Chocolate hazelnut tart - recommended by the guy at the counter, I had high hopes for this one, and the chocolate filling, although not really hazelnut-y was decent, but the crust was dry and hard and not ok.
Mini fruit tart - this was the best of the lot, the crust was decent, the custard added moistness. But it didn't make me ooh or ahh either. 

I am disappointed I can't use their baked goods for our event, but they just didn't wow me.

So to sum it up, It's a little out of the way for me, but if I lived closer I would definitely go there often. I was eyeing the chocolate croissant, one of my favorite all time pastries, and I will go for a larger sandwich next time, and maybe sample this salted caramel brownie that is so popular. 

Charlotte needs more non cookie-cutter cafes like this.",2010-08-23 21:53:16

773,1059,2.0,"Have none of these people stayed at the sister Hotel, the venetian? Soooo much better there with nearly identical room set-ups but the Palazzo is not as comfortable.
We were very suprised to see so many differences between the two, especially on the negative side since this was the newer of the two hotels. My boyfriend and I agreed that this had to be the hotel geared more towards older folks since the venetian has since gone to a younger crowd with clubs like Tao and Tao Beach bringing in the younger crowds. 
With the Palazzo we found a more uncomfortable bed, a 3 HOUR wait for room service, one of those slow rain showers that take a few more hours to get my conditioner out of my hair, and calling to have our room cleaned...and then they never show up. HA!  Even the pool is quiet and small, but thankfully you can walk over to The Venetian pool as well.

Pick the Venetian, it is close to the same but BETTER =)",2008-08-18 20:36:10
1489,226,3.0,Advantage and e z are sister companies. We waited so long at advantage and they are unwilling to price match their online price. Then we went to ez and they matched for us but they kept on messing up on everything. We arrived before 3pm and got out at 5! But ez is still better than advantage in that the customer service is  better.,2015-11-02 00:42:46
