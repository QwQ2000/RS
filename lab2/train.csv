We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize.

23,22,5.0,"Ikea....an experience!

I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.

When you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! 

Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!

Do yourself a favor, plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom, have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit, then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires!

This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating.

Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed! 

I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate! 

The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an ""ice cream bar,"" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.

Olive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!",2013-08-03 15:44:57

Sangria I has was watery & unflavorful, but got me buzzed. That was part of the point of the drink, but I like a craftily concocted cocktail or elixir & this one was not.

But, (I'm using a lot of buts...) the unchicken & waffles was quite okay. They used veggie meat & they did quite a good job making it like chicken. Since I can't do Roscoe's cause I'm a veggie, this spot did the trick. If Roscoe's was in Europe it would be a different story...

It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet, it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.

The atmosphere was not to my liking. Very cafe-like and crowded.

49,24,2.0,"Having dined at many other Vegas buffets (the Wynn, the Paris, the Mirage, etc.) I found myself very underwhelmed. Everyone raves about the Bellagio buffet but I just kept wishing I had gone to the Wynn.
The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.
I will say that the fruit was fresh and yummy (melon, berries, etc.) and the desserts were good, but it wasn't enough to make me want to come back here ever again.",2010-07-07 16:03:41

Unlimited alcohol, wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games. 

I wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in Mirage and hungry, I'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon. I wouldn't spend full retail price eating there. Other buffets on the strip are better for same price points.",2014-09-09 19:15:26

I don't have dental insurance, but they have this insurance through their office you can purchase for $80 something a year and this gave me 25% off all of my dental work, plus they helped me get signed up for care credit which I knew nothing about before this visit!

The food was brought to us within ten minutes of ordering (successfully taming the hangry beast that was brewing) and any modification to our order was done correctly! The food itself was pretty good.

8,8,4.0,"notes: 1 visit, breakfast/lunch
overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.

highlights: 
- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.
- Prime rib is excellent
- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.
- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

Avoid:
- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.
- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.",2010-01-08 04:28:23

It tasted good because at 2:30am we were all hungry.  I ordered to go since the place was packed from all the clubbers and hotel guests that was here.

Our server (i believe her name was Nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful. She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice. I'd give this place one more try...But I most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again.",2015-01-03 22:17:56

This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating.

33,31,3.0,"The service was pretty bad. There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any. 

Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas. 

The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. 

One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. 

Definitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.",2013-10-03 08:38:38
20,19,2.0,"The only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because of their food and drinks. Their service however, is probably the WORST I've ever had. I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat. 

When we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was ""going to be complicated or not."" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too. 

I had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service. Definitely do NOT recommend going there!!! Don't know exactly which was our original waitress but our checks said Joanne G.

15,14,2.0,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2017-01-02 03:48:03

My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. 

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either.

89,24,3.0,"I remember coming to the Buffet at the Bellagio several years ago for Sunday Champagne Brunch and being blown away.   It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.  

Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.

As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  

Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.

23,22,5.0,"Ikea....an experience!

I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.

When you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! 

Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!

Do yourself a favor, plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom, have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit, then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires!

The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was relaxing inside and outside. The food presentation was impressive.  Service was just OK. The sushi was cut very think and cooked just perfect.

15,14,2.0,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2017-01-02 03:48:03

It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet, it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.

I'm not a native so when I moved to the area many years ago everyone advised my family that we absolutely had to try a burnt almond torte from Prantl's.

However, I have worked across the street from them for a decade now, and the office ladies I work with have brought in nearly everything they sell at Prantl's over the last decade.  The cookies, the cupcakes, the junior pastries, danishes, donuts, etc... have all made there way into our office, and I have never been wowed by any of them.  In fact I find most items to be pretty sub par.  I think if Prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars, but that's not the case, and since I have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery, not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition, I find them to be quite lackluster overall.  If you want a true bakery treat I would suggest  La Gourmandine for anything, Vanilla for cupcakes, Jean Marc Chatellier, even the somewhat overrated Oakmont Bakery, as other than the burnt almond torte, you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting Giant Eagle quality, which is fine, but at that point you might as well go to Giant Eagle and pay accordingly.",2013-09-04 00:22:15

I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.

I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 

They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.

Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us.

This came back to bite me in the ass as I made the mistake of leaving my guestlist line for the shorter staff entry line. Members of my group were with this female staff member who said could get us all free in even though our guy:girl ratio had more guys. I spoke with her personally to make sure of it before I left my line. Well...SHE LIED! The bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys:girls, leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry. My girlfriend was not pleased with the fact that one of my other group members (who came stag) got in for free and I didn't. Whatever, lesson learned. Don't rush in. Don't be tempted by an open bar or a shorter line. Stick with guestlist if you're approved. Make sure your group ratio is even or favors girls. Don't listen to otherwise!

Club Layout: The club itself is very nice. Not quite as grand or spacious as XS next door, but a beautiful venue nonetheless. Main dance floor is average sized. It was spacious enough so that we didn't feel like canned sardines and had adequate room to dance. There are no stairs or steps to climb, a la Marquee, so ladies will appreciate this. The main room is flanked by a large tent-like area and the outdoor wading pool/patio area. The easiest accessible restrooms are outside as well (the indoor one gets crowded). The outdoor area is ideal for those who want to socialize more, take pictures, take a breather, etc. It's beautiful.

Bar: The indoor bar layout is terrible. There was maybe 10 feet between the bar and the backs of the booths for those who got tables. This 10 feet also serves as the main walkway to get to the tent and outdoor area. Not so surprisingly, there is a lot of pushing, bouncers shining lights and telling you to move, and it worst of all: it takes forever to get a drink! I said before to not by tempted by an open bar for ladies and here's why: this is the only bar ladies can get free drinks from! On top of that, ladies can only get one drink at a time! So ladies, if you planned to be here for an hour and get drunk or pass drinks to the guys, you'll be disappointed.The outdoor bar nudged in between the tent/outdoor area is empty and stress-free compared to the one inside, so I would recommend buying drinks from here. Drinks were typical Vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per.

Overall, I had a great experience at Surrender. The club was beautiful, my group had a blast, and Morgan Page (and his opener) rocked it! Learn from my mistake, stay away from the indoor bar, and come with great people and you will have one memorable night! 4/5.",2012-12-04 07:49:34
54,51,4.0,"We had a great stay at the Platinum.  I had no qualms at staying at a non-gaming (read: not a casino) hotel off the Strip.  It's a quick walk to all the action (about 5 to 10 minutes to the Flamingo depending on how quick you pound the pavement).  

The suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.

Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.

I never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).

The restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times), but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu, signature cocktails, wines by the glass, bottles that are sold by the glass, and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day, all night. 

We frequented the happy hour several times during our trip, and we were stoked every visit.  

We plan on making this our home next time we stop in Vegas.  It's the perfect getaway off the Strip.",2013-10-24 03:17:56
145,44,5.0,"I am currently finishing up an incredible meal. Literally still in the restaurant, but I can't wait to post this. Not because of the food (though that was delish), but because of our server, Clenard.

We came in, sat for maybe ten minutes, when he came over, profusely apologized for our wait, and informed us he'd be getting us bruschetta on the house. Then, as we proceeded to order, he was incredibly attentive and helpful. My friend got around four Arnold palmers, and he kept them coming!! He was cordial, kind and incredibly professional. Then we also received dessert on the house (for a wait that, honestly, was NOT bad). Everyone was wonderful, and I'm sure clenard is a reflection of the entire staff and restaurant. 

Because of this amazing server (and, not to forget, an awesome meal of the lamb meatballs and artichoke heart salad) I am set on being a regular here.

15,14,2.0,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2017-01-02 03:48:03

I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating.

Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed! 

I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate! 

The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an ""ice cream bar,"" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.

Olive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!",2013-08-03 15:44:57

23,22,5.0,"Ikea....an experience!

I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.

When you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! 

Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!

Do yourself a favor, plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom, have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit, then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires!

118,50,5.0,"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.
Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone.

My typical order is jerk chicken fried rice and egg foo yung with another varying meat option. I've tried the black beans and have to admit they're pretty good but I'm just not a big fan of lentils. I prefer having more rice.

I love the egg foo yung. I dislike a lot of Americanized Chinese food dishes, but egg foo yung is one exception. My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top.

I finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas. My coworkers swear by the Jade Red Chicken inside a quesadilla. A strange combination, but it's actually really good. I've heard that machaca inside a quesadilla is also good.

54,11,5.0,"Before we went to see ""Love"" at the Mirage, my boyfriend and I came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at Onda.  We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.

We were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.

After we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.

We also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.

For our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. 

We ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.

Earlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.

54,11,5.0,"Before we went to see ""Love"" at the Mirage, my boyfriend and I came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at Onda.  We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.

We were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.

After we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.

We also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.

For our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. 

We ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.

Earlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.

Amazing food, wonderful service.  You won't be disappointed at Onda.",2013-10-24 02:28:30

The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil. 

Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice.

85,77,4.0,"This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus ""tapas"" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the ""Halal"" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant.

82,74,2.0,"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.",2015-01-03 21:34:24

Our server (i believe her name was Nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful. She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice. I'd give this place one more try...But I most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again.",2015-01-03 22:17:56

130,35,3.0,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.",2015-04-01 13:34:47
89,24,3.0,"I remember coming to the Buffet at the Bellagio several years ago for Sunday Champagne Brunch and being blown away.   It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.  

Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.

As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  

Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.

118,50,5.0,"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.
Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone.

15,14,2.0,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2017-01-02 03:48:03

It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet, it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.

82,74,2.0,"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.",2015-01-03 21:34:24

I am constantly in search of the perfect Pad Thai, so when a thai friend recommended this place, had to try.....

My meal:
Pad Thai:  awesome!  Table spices were super fresh (hotter than I expected) and the noodles were excellent.  5 stars.

My friend's meal:
Pad woon sen:  2.5 out of 5 (by her reporting); she ordered ""combination: chicken, beef, and shrimp"" and received LITERALLY one (1) shrimp.  ONE.... The flavor of the noodles was great, she said, but there were way too many onions, carrots, and not enough meat.",2015-05-26 08:37:10
181,37,5.0,"Whoa! This was an unexpected last meal while in town. Yelp helped me sort restaurants,  and when I saw BBQ towards the top of the list..decision was easy. 

The meats here are truly outstanding. Brisket was amazing...great crusty bark and beautiful smoke ring on the tender beef. The pork ribs have to be in my top 2 best of all time, up there with LA BBQ. The sausage went down nice and smooth. Not too spicy, good snap from the casing, and slightly coarse ground beef and pork blend. That's the texas trinity,  and I never expected to have it be so good in Arizona. Bravo!

Sides: I tried the beans, potato salad, and grits.  Beans were slightly too thick for me. Very hearty if you like it that way. Potato salad was a tiny bit undercooked.  Just personal preference for me..i like it easier to bite through. Grits were awesome though, really tasty!

89,24,3.0,"I remember coming to the Buffet at the Bellagio several years ago for Sunday Champagne Brunch and being blown away.   It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.  

Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.

As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  

Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.

The suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.

Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.

I met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine. 

There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink. 

I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling. 

Customer service is VERY GOOD! They are all very helpful and fast, so please be ready to order!

overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.

highlights: 
- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.
- Prime rib is excellent
- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.
- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

Avoid:
- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.

I had the philly with onion and mushroom and white american cheese and the homemade chips and it was all delicious. The sandwich had a lot of flavor without being really greasy (as cheesesteaks often are) and the chips were a good mix of crispy and soft that I expect when I'm getting homemade chips. 

Other dishes at the table - chicken club sandwich (reportedly VERY good) and a cheeseburger (reported as Ok, but he ate it all so it couldnt have been too bad!!)

Note: They had the BEST Sweet tea I've had in a few years. Really super delish.

Anyway, we got here after 11PM and were seated. We specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. You mean the 15 seat bar? We don't drink so I declined. Not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... Our mediocre late night snack came to $70....

Should stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go. 

Salt and pepper squid- good. Not overly fried. Lime was nice touch.

Samba strip, salmon avocado and spicy tuna... nothing fancy and have had way better.",2015-07-16 07:10:34
89,24,3.0,"I remember coming to the Buffet at the Bellagio several years ago for Sunday Champagne Brunch and being blown away.   It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.  

Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.

As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  

Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.  I'm just not feeling the love for this place this time.",2012-05-28 16:52:50

The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.

85,77,4.0,"This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus ""tapas"" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the ""Halal"" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant. In the meantime go and see Amer and get a taste sensation fix...tell him Nick sent you!",2014-12-17 18:21:11
145,44,5.0,"I am currently finishing up an incredible meal. Literally still in the restaurant, but I can't wait to post this. Not because of the food (though that was delish), but because of our server, Clenard.

We came in, sat for maybe ten minutes, when he came over, profusely apologized for our wait, and informed us he'd be getting us bruschetta on the house. Then, as we proceeded to order, he was incredibly attentive and helpful. My friend got around four Arnold palmers, and he kept them coming!! He was cordial, kind and incredibly professional. Then we also received dessert on the house (for a wait that, honestly, was NOT bad). Everyone was wonderful, and I'm sure clenard is a reflection of the entire staff and restaurant. 

Because of this amazing server (and, not to forget, an awesome meal of the lamb meatballs and artichoke heart salad) I am set on being a regular here.

252,35,4.0,"My hubby and I stayed at the Venetian during the week last week. The price was great (169/night) with a package that included $40 off the Phantom of the Opera show tickets! We were definitely planning on seeing it, so it was perfect! There were other discounts in the package (to an Asian restaurant and a Mexican one at Palazzo) but we didn't use those. 

The Venetian...OMG, I loved that place! The perfume scent that others complain about in their reviews, actually wasn't bad...I was worried about it, being highly allergic to strong smelling perfumes, but it was actually really nice...I even miss it now...I didn't sneeze at all from it. We arrived early, 2pm, and they checked is in no problem (3pm is checkin)...Our room was very-very nice, my hubby's jaw sort of dropped when he first saw the room (I booked the whole thing so I already saw the pictures). It was very spacious, from the bathroom to the bedroom/living room...3 TVs in the place! I subtracted a star though b/c our TV in the bathroom did not work :( I was bummed b/c being a woman I spend a LOTTA time in there :) 

The pool area on the 4th floor was very nice (there's another pool with more shade and more privacy on the 10th floor too)...I didn't check out Tao Beach, because I didnt even realize that was in a different area until later. My hubby walked by it and said it was nothing major, so I believed him. There were sufficient chairs at the pool, and the waitresses came by occasionally to see if anyone needed drinks. They could've made more money personally if they came by more frequently. Drinks were good, and the restaurant (Riva by Wolfgang Puck) has really good lunch menu (Pizza was great, and their salads too). 

Overall, next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely stay at the Venetian.",2009-05-19 17:15:20
173,12,4.0,Caveat right up front. I was attending a JT concert and hadn't been to a concert in a large venue since Prince in LA at the forum. So if you've been to the forum - anything is better. Having said that - I'm not sure what they do with their employees because everyone and I mean everyone was soooooo nice. You had to wait in long lines to get cocktails - but everyone was so nice you ended up not minding....that much. The acoustics we're great for JT but the opening act - not so much. The only thing I didn't like is because it is such a large venue even great seats weren't that good and up close.,2018-04-27 20:16:35
209,154,3.0,"I was reasonably impressed with AB. We got there just before the lunch rush and scored a prime table near the windows (tho upon leaving, my friend noted how cozy the sofa-bench tables looked, so I'll aim for one of those next time). Our server, Robert, made even the soup of the day (tomato bisque) sound out of this world. Even after the restaurant filled up, he was attentive and made sure we enjoyed our meal. 

We shared a handful of oysters with a mild jalapeño sauce. They could have been a bit briny-ier for my taste. And for entrees, we hit opposite ends of the taste spectrum: I had the pork carnitas, which was mild and sweet, with avocado, cole slaw, and a corn 'pancake,' with only a bit of red onion to balance it out. My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. The bite I tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me. 

The decor was comforting in a British pub style. I wish the menu had been more unique (burgers, BLT, variety of salads), esp for a place with the wird ""arrogant"" staring at you.

204,59,5.0,"My friend and I ate here for dinner after our full day on the Strip having fun. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, since there was almost a full house that night. The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.

The crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!

The Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!

My friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!",2017-03-15 02:28:50

As soon as you walk in, the staff is nice a friendly and SUPER helpful if you've never been there before. Anyways, the food is what you really wanna know about. This is, hands down, the best Chinese food I have had. The red jade chicken is perfect. Sweet, a little spicy, and crisp from the breading (some places there chicken like that is soggy and not very good). The refried beans are so yummy as well, I just wish they were a little thicker.

I opted to remove the middle bun and it was just like a double patty with cheese and toppings. I would never have guessed it was vegan. MUST TRY! The fries were crispy and fresh.

I ordered the angry hot dog because I like spicy foods and when I took a big...I was hit with so much good flavors. It was so good.

My brother ordered the bulgoigi dog and it looked good too. My brother scarfed it down and he is a picky eater and doesn't like hot dogs that much so I'm glad he liked it.  

There is more menu items than what it displayed in on the website. There is so many things I want to try there so I am definitely coming back here.",2015-02-02 09:49:16
203,151,5.0,"Emily, Nadia and the guys are unbelievable culinary and customer happiness geniuses in a sea of blah and ugh! This is my third visit here and my first visit ever having Greek food. Emily introduced me to everything on the menu with a upbeat personality that you cannot find anywhere these days. The food was exceptional I had the Gyro with their mind numbingly delicious French fries. Possibly the best french fries I've ever tasted, no joke. On my second visit I tried their steak kebab which was suggested by the fabulous Nadia. Another homerun! The meat here is beyond tender, delicious and fresh. My third visit I tried the Gyro #1 again and I am so glad I made the trip back here. Emily actually remembered my nephew and I and of course the guys in the back greeted us with a hearty hello. Place is clean, very reasonable for the amount of food you get and always keeps you hankering for the next visit. Try the Greek pita you will be incredibly pleased!",2018-04-04 02:28:06
16,15,3.0,"The decor and everything int he restaurant is really nice and sheik looking. We got the Resting Panda and the Whiskey sour, both of which were very tasting drinks. We started with the Foo Foo plater (just to be able to try a bit of everything). It was pretty good actually, I'd highly recommend it! Our server (i believe her name was Nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful. She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice. I'd give this place one more try...But I most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again.",2015-01-03 22:17:56

Sangria I has was watery & unflavorful, but got me buzzed. That was part of the point of the drink, but I like a craftily concocted cocktail or elixir & this one was not.

But, (I'm using a lot of buts...) the unchicken & waffles was quite okay. They used veggie meat & they did quite a good job making it like chicken. Since I can't do Roscoe's cause I'm a veggie, this spot did the trick. If Roscoe's was in Europe it would be a different story...

It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet, it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.

The atmosphere was not to my liking. Very cafe-like and crowded.

But it's an alright spot. I may or may not go back.",2014-05-25 20:30:31

181,37,5.0,"Whoa! This was an unexpected last meal while in town. Yelp helped me sort restaurants,  and when I saw BBQ towards the top of the list..decision was easy. 

The meats here are truly outstanding. Brisket was amazing...great crusty bark and beautiful smoke ring on the tender beef. The pork ribs have to be in my top 2 best of all time, up there with LA BBQ. The sausage went down nice and smooth. Not too spicy, good snap from the casing, and slightly coarse ground beef and pork blend. That's the texas trinity,  and I never expected to have it be so good in Arizona. Bravo!

Sides: I tried the beans, potato salad, and grits.  Beans were slightly too thick for me. Very hearty if you like it that way. Potato salad was a tiny bit undercooked.  Just personal preference for me..i like it easier to bite through. Grits were awesome though, really tasty!

130,35,3.0,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.",2015-04-01 13:34:47
307,24,4.0,"I looked forward to this event the whole weekend I was in Vegas, after seeing a special on the travel channel. I am a food enthusiast and they painted a very tantalizing picture on TV.

We had to wait in line for about 45 minutes but it seemed to move at a steady pace, and we got there at 12:20 so it was probably one of the busiest times to get there.

I was pleasantly surprised at the price, I expected to pay 45 dollars but it was only 28... so that was a bonus for me.

There were so many selections it was mind blowing! The leg of lamb was fantastic...asparagus was excellent, and most of the seafood dishes were great. The roasted turkey was great too. If you like your meat like I do, you'll enjoy this buffet. 

I was hoping for crab legs and creme brulee but neither were offered (maybe they offer that for dinner?) so I was a bit crestfallen since I didn't get 2 of the things I was most looking forward to. 

Next time I think I will try some other buffets just to see if this one truly was the best as the travel channel touts.",2008-08-18 21:50:39

Prices are decent especially for Vegas and the food is delicious.  I have never had something I didn't like.  My favorite was the brunch tapas menu.  For a set price (I think it was $20 for brunch plus $5 for mimosas) you get unlimited tapas and mimosas.  The tapas menu had about 20 items on it and everyone I had was amazing.  I was so full I had to stop.  The plantain empanada, mini burito, and Machaca Chilaquiles were particularly amazing.  My mouth is watering thinking about them.  

The service was also amazing.  We had a group of 10 and it was very fast even with the large group.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating.

82,74,2.0,"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.",2015-01-03 21:34:24

They have a nice bar with two TVs,and across from it,little community tables which are all open seating. The restaurant is quite large and there's plenty of seating inside and outside as well. The view whilst sitting outside is really pretty- they often have lights, you can see the bridge and canal, etc. The crowd is all ages- I love that everyone dresses up and makes an effort- whether it's families with toddlers, first dates or a group of friends. On weekends I think they have a DJ. I typically always get the all natural chicken and lamb meatballs- they're delicious. I've tried the flatbreads, and other chicken (can't remember the name) those were all good too. Their deserts change but all have been really delicious. The wine selection is ok, beer not so much, but the cocktails are pretty tasty. They also have a bakery/market at the other end with gelato. The bathrooms are always clean and the service is good.

For any first timers, like us, don't stress it. They go over patiently on how to use the car, even when you ask multiple times. Garrett was our guide and he was so nice and patient considering we got lost and ended up on the main road... again. Although we felt that the two guides got a little mad at us for getting lost, we still had a blast!

The tour lasts about four hours from the time they pick you up to drop off. We highly recommend Scoot City and the Red Rock Canyon Tour. It was amazing!!!!!!!

Although i have only had the chicken, you cannot go wrong with it.  I have had the 1/2 chicken and also the crispy chicken burrito and both were very good.  In addition, I always get the yucca fries; my lunch order is now a burrito with yucca fries and all for under $10 and i can't finish it all.  In addition, always get the green sauce and use it to your heat tolerance.  It definitely has a kick to it, so mix it with some mayo especially for the yucca fries.

We always get the hamachi jalapeño roll and some sashimi so don't get me wrong when I say the rolls are better than the sashimi. It's still enjoyable. Good atmosphere and my girl likes the martinis. Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon and Kiku in Station Square are better. Nakama is good for some enjoyable sushi and, more importantly, the atmosphere.

249,51,4.0,"Platinum Hotel is a nice hotel.  The rooms are clean, and the place lacks all the smoke and noise of the hotels that are closer to the strip.  For some people this is a good thing, but for those looking forward to being able to gamble and whatnot till 4AM in the morning and then take an elevator to your room to rest, try elsewhere.  Besides that though, this place is great.

My only gripe with this hotel was one involving me reserving 2 Queen/Solitaire Suite with (2) Queen Beds, but when I got there they only had the (2) suites with (1) King Bed each.  I spoke with them and called in for the pull in beds and it also helped that the couch was also a pull out too, so that served our needs.  So, all in all, wasn't a deal breaker.  

I did like the suites though for the most part, bathroom was huge, Kitchen came stocked with glasses, silverware, and small appliances, no pots or pans, but it didn't matter.  Although we didn't use it that much, it was nice to have it available to us if we did.

The place itself is located (2) blocks from the strip and is pretty easy to find from the 15 Freeway.  Get off on flamingo and keep driving down, and it will be on your right.  

All in all, not a bad hotel, just make sure you confirm A FEW times before you go there.",2009-05-19 17:11:32

152,122,2.0,"My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. 
I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone.",2017-11-06 17:56:52

Sangria I has was watery & unflavorful, but got me buzzed. That was part of the point of the drink, but I like a craftily concocted cocktail or elixir & this one was not.

But, (I'm using a lot of buts...) the unchicken & waffles was quite okay. They used veggie meat & they did quite a good job making it like chicken. Since I can't do Roscoe's cause I'm a veggie, this spot did the trick. If Roscoe's was in Europe it would be a different story...

It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet, it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.

The atmosphere was not to my liking. Very cafe-like and crowded.

There is also the USS Requin exhibit that allows you to tour the submarine.  I had no idea that this was the US Navy's first Radar picket submarine! 

After you are done with the science center, walk on over to Sports Works! (it is included in the admission). It is so much fun but requires a lot of physical activity. Make sure you are wearing comfortable clothing as some of the exhibits require you bouncing or running.

The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the ""Halal"" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.

The food is spectacular. We had a total of 4 in a group, we all ordered different items and we all are raving about this place.
I had the bacon and egg burrito, and it was the best I have ever had. 
The crepe, the salsa and the sauce absolutely heavenly.
We also tried the strawberry and creme crepe - deelish. 
The crepe with ham and cheese - deelish! 
The place is small and the decor minimal, but who cares when the food is that good.
The staff - really nice and helpful. They even brought out some new desserts for us to test for free.
It may take a little longer than you think it should to get your food...but I am telling you it is because they are working magic in the kitchen to get you their deeeelish crepes!

The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the ""Halal"" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant.

It would be nice if they offered replacement utensils other than just the ones on the table, although I guess maybe it's like that so that too much water isn't wasted.

There were a large variety of food dishes to choose from. They make the price of $40/person a good deal by offering a lot of expensive dishes.

15,14,2.0,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2017-01-02 03:48:03

My husband I chose classics: manicotti and cheese ravioli- $25.95 each. They tasted frozen and processed- not authentic. 

Each meal comes with a house salad, red and/or white House wine, garlic bread and a cappuccino.  The salad was so-so. It has a slice (like you would get at the deli counter) of salami in it with a hunk of processed mozzarella cheese and is slightly overdressed.   The wine was for sure cheap, but I wasn't expecting anything fancy considering it was included. The meal, depending on what you picked, doesn't take too long to get there but again, isn't anything to write home about.  It seemed like previously frozen, processed pasta- not homemade- with processed cheeses and canned sauce. I've had better at chains. The garlic bread wasn't fresh- seemed like it had been sitting a while and was hard. I tasted the cappuccino and it was ok but had a strong nutty flavor, almost like pecan.

130,35,3.0,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

223,163,2.0,"Teharu is supremely average. The clientele left something to be desired (I guess that's not their fault though), as when I visited it was full of ASU students. The music was some terrible Billboard 100 mix. I don't know, when I eat sushi I don't really want to listen to what's on 97.5, I guess. 

Anyway, the food was pretty terrible. I do like the conveyor belt style, since it's a cool part of eating sushi in Japan, but I feel like they didn't really pull it off. Instead of a small amount of fresh sushi going around, it was packed full of rolls that could've been there for hours, getting warm (I didn't notice any quality control). We visited a while ago so I can't remember what exactly I tried, but it was forgettable. Tasted like grocery store sushi; very fishy and didn't have a really fresh flavor at all. Even for the price (dirt cheap), it really wasn't worth it for SUCH a sub-par meal. The cream puffs were pretty good though, and I was really amused at the snack-paks and apple juice cartons going around too. 

I've seen some reviews complaining about the service, but I thought the service was actually pretty good. Just had to signal someone to come over for the check and they were very attentive and nice, quick about getting it to us and giving my card back.

In summary, the next day there were stomachaches had by everyone we'd gone there with, so I will not be back; 2 stars for the cream puffs and the staff.",2012-01-03 16:29:55

I'm a little unsettled venturing out to restaurants/bars by myself, but sitting at the bar and ordering during my solo visit was a great experience.  The bartender was very welcoming and made me feel less self-conscious that I was drinking and eating by myself among the 20, 30-somethings all around out for their happy hour festivities.  I think the biggest appeal for me was that this place reminds me of a lot of the places I loved when living in Austin.  It's a charming house converted to a restaurant/bar with a really nice outdoor patio area.  Both times, I had Sophie's Salad.  Delicious!  I also tried the Salty Hog, which is a great choice if you're looking for a refreshing mixed drink (and you're a bacon lover).  I will definitely go back if I'm out in Phoenix again!",2015-01-04 01:11:33

276,59,4.0,"I went here on a Thursday night and had a pretty good experience. The waiter knew the menu inside and out, as well as the cocktails and what items were the best on the menu. Obviously food in Vegas is very overpriced but it was yummy!

Try the chicken biscuits as an appetizer - it only comes with 2 so make sure you get at least two orders. I got the wedge salad with shrimp but the shrimp were way overcooked. Try the bone marrow as an appetizer as well!

They were all out of a shrimp macaroni and cheese, which was the special of the day, so that was unfortunate. Literally a few minutes before that the waiter announced that they had that on the menu and then he had to come back and tell us that they ran out so he should've been a little more prepared.

There are fees tacked on for everything and you have to be careful with what you are doing. This is my first time taking Allegiant and usually we take United Airlines. My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren't expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant's response was to ""do it yourself"". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude.

My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. 

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either.

They were small and very average.  Providing a tasty dipping sauce with the wings doesn't compensate for small blah wings you could find anywhere.  We went back again 2 days later and tried the Trash Can Nachos.  Ours looked nowhere like the picture and was overloaded with a nasty tasting cheese that overpowered the entire dish.  I never thought I'd use the words 'too much cheese', but this was just nasty.  $20 Nachos should at least taste great. I'll upload a picture of them after posting this review.

Onto the good.....

We had Spicy Bloody Mary's on both visits.  Worth the $15 price each and huge. It's a little inconsistent on toppings, but nonetheless really good.

Service was a little slow on my first visit, but after seeing the Bloody Mary, I understood why It took a little longer, and I was fine with that.

The take.......

Bring those Fire Ball wings back.  Why would you even take something so good off the menu, only to replace them with something people can get anywhere?

Either revisit the Trashcan Nachos recipe, or revisit the staff that are making it.  Who would ever expect Nachos to be bad?  How do you screw that up?  That cheese is pungent nasty.",2018-06-19 15:58:52

142,111,1.0,"We live near this Denny's and service has been hit or miss so we normally avoid it. I wanted moons over my hammy so we went to Denny's and my husband even expressed his concern. I should have listened. There was one table with 2 people at it, at 9pm at night, that should have told us everything. We stood up front waiting to be seated, there was no one around to seat us. Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn't smile, didn't say I'll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw). Imagine when walked in we were greeted and told they would be right with us. The manager saw us and immediately went to try and seat us while he was in the middle of something. I'm done with the Denny's. You have sealed the deal I won't be back and with the way things looked the restaurant sales won't keep you in business either.",2016-05-19 04:33:26
152,122,2.0,"My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. 
I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone.",2017-11-06 17:56:52

118,50,5.0,"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.
Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone. Just text him! He is AMAZZZINNNGG. He will walk you in, he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions.

141,94,2.0,"When it comes to the usual Costco deals and weekly road shows, this Costco is fine, but there are two big problems with this store:

1. In the last few months, the sample severs have gotten increasingly cranky and sometimes outright hostile. They have always been rude to my kids, who are generally polite, but today takes the cake. The server CHEWED out my son for touching one sample, then the other. Normally, that would be bad beahvior, but these were fully wrapped chocolates, not some greasy fish stick. The guy -- who was working the CHRISTMAS SECTION --  was so mad, I had to tell my son not to worry about it as we quickly walked away.

About half of the servers at this store are polite enough, but NONE of them EVER SMILE.

2. Even worse than the servers are the patrons, who are horrid creatures reminiscent of goblins from the Hobbit. Here are some examples:

*One time, two elderly women started swearing at each other as they fought for the parking spot I was trying to vacate. One woman, whose husband was driving in circles on the opposite side of the parking lot, literally stood in the spot I left while the other tried to run her over. I wish I was exaggerating, but I had to roll up my windows so the kids couldn't here the exchange of swear words. 

*My kids have been shoved out of the way of samples as if they have no right to be there.

*My kids have been rammed with carts by impatient shoppers who don't seem to understand that youngsters can get disorientated by the frenetic nature of that particular store. Heck, the traffic jams near the ready-to-eat chicken area can run 10-15 carts deep.

*I've had customers literally push us out of the way to lay claim to some product or another.

The staff is okay at this store, which I've frequented since 2008, but they don't work as hard at being friendly or helpful compared with other stores I've visited. I don't know what, if anything, they can do about the bad customers, but it seems they should at least be aware that the Scottsdale store is out of control.",2014-10-11 05:12:18

15,49,5.0,"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.

I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.

I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 

They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.

Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed.

overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.

- Prime rib is excellent
- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.
- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

For any first timers, like us, don't stress it. They go over patiently on how to use the car, even when you ask multiple times. Garrett was our guide and he was so nice and patient considering we got lost and ended up on the main road... again. Although we felt that the two guides got a little mad at us for getting lost, we still had a blast!

The tour lasts about four hours from the time they pick you up to drop off. We highly recommend Scoot City and the Red Rock Canyon Tour. It was amazing!!!!!!!

The suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.

Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.

I never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).

The restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times), but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu, signature cocktails, wines by the glass, bottles that are sold by the glass, and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day, all night. 

We frequented the happy hour several times during our trip, and we were stoked every visit.

We suggest other restaurants in this area.",2017-02-19 15:09:41
464,256,5.0,"Fantastic! Think, Subway or Chipotle's ordering concept, but with pizza. You pay a standard price and can get as many toppings as you want. Speaking of, their topping choices are numerous and unique offering endless pizza building options. If you aren't in the mood to build your own pizza you can order one of their signature pies. It's a great place for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike. The service is very quick and the staff is very courteous and personable. I'm always greeted with a smile and ""thank you"".

+ Great Food (variety, healthy, quality, unique)
+ Good Service
+ Fun Location (despite being in congested uptown)
+ Good Price",2016-02-24 00:01:23

283,106,5.0,"Initial thoughts upon sitting down with a beer and hitting my first 15 shots: holy cow, I want to build one of these for myself! 

Getting to the nitty gritty of the review and thinking of the questions people would ask before visiting my review becomes a bit more specific. 

#1 * The wait staff was hired yesterday. Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here. They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions. 

#2 * Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out. 

#3 * Computer systems down. There were more error screens than you could imagine here. One of the staff even said the app has never worked here. That's pathetic. Get someone on it. 

My review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said, otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon), which doesn't at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had. 

* Our waitress Michelle was amazing. It looks like she only had two tables, so you can't beat a ratio of 1:9. She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table. 

* The music varies a ton! A good thing! I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music. 

* OMG The food! The food was top quality. Worth twice what it costs. No joke. 



It is blatantly obvious I'm a bullet/list reviewer so here are my key points. 
*Technology- 6/10 train staff and hire an IT person. 
* Staff- 10/10 Some of the most friendly and eager staff I've seen around. Keep it up. 
* Food- 10/10 Id come here just to eat. Period. 
* Overall experience- 9/10 This place was a blast. I plan on visiting as often as I can when in the area. It is totally worth every penny.",2015-01-03 21:29:38

I wasn't too hungry, but I could eat. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos--which were seasoned to perfection. So of course I was obliged to return. I came back the next day to get a burrito. Returned the next for a chimichanga.

Instead of a small amount of fresh sushi going around, it was packed full of rolls that could've been there for hours, getting warm (I didn't notice any quality control). We visited a while ago so I can't remember what exactly I tried, but it was forgettable. Tasted like grocery store sushi; very fishy and didn't have a really fresh flavor at all.

Dan Dan noodles didn't contain one grain of pork, though not advertised as such, I generally get some pork love in my Dan Dan.  Noods arrived quite mushy, hence why I preferred the cold sesame.
Potstickers arrive in a way that I had not seen before - cooked as a sheet and with a crisp bottom - fascinating idea, but it prevented us from cleanly separating the dumplings from the rest, so filling got torn out.

The flavor was excellent, but clearly BLD is not holding the food at proper temps which is concerning, especially with pork.  I also had an over medium eggs served that had the whites still running clear.  So undercooked and unsafe, I couldn't believe the the kitchen and the server sent it out!

Other times, the service was just OK.  Managers were around, but never stopped by when there was a problem with undercooked or cold food.  Cook times are long.

82,74,2.0,"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.",2015-01-03 21:34:24

I met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine. 

There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink. 

I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling. 

Customer service is VERY GOOD! They are all very helpful and fast, so please be ready to order!

I had made this rating a 4, and changed it to a 5. Because now that I'm writing this review, I want some more good food and good service.

Nice work guys!!",2015-03-18 18:19:32

We did have their standard suite, but was great enough! A very nice sitting area, complete with a big comfy couch to relax on. Just sunk right into the bed at the end of the day. Lots of closet room and dresser space, and the bathroom was amazing! Wonderful shower and a very large soaking tub. Kind of wished I had a chance to check out that tub! ;p ~

The guest serves were excellent and a late night stroll around the Palazo was magnificent! The hotel itself is amazingly designed and makes you feel like royalty. The pools and hot tub were worth the time out from a day exploring just to relax and take in the gardens surrounding them. Just wear sandels, the concrete is HOT!!

The restaurants at the Venetian sounded very enticing, although we never did eat here. We did manage to sneak in a Gondola ride! Cheesy yes. Touristy...you bet!! But worth every minute!! And their voices are amazing!

Was very happy that we stayed. Absolutely loved this hotel, and when I return to Vegas, will be looking into staying again!",2012-06-26 04:00:14

We also got the brussel sprouts with cashews. Just the vinaigrette with the roasted sprouts is amazing. I can't explain the taste but if you like brussel sprouts, get this! For the main, my mom and I split the grilled branzino and the grilled octopus. The branzino was delicious. Perfectly grilled, and not too dry. The octopus wasn't cooked enough in my opinion. It's very hard to do, but it just wasn't the correct texture. Overall, Cleo is a great place.

As soon as you walk in, the staff is nice a friendly and SUPER helpful if you've never been there before. Anyways, the food is what you really wanna know about. This is, hands down, the best Chinese food I have had. The red jade chicken is perfect. Sweet, a little spicy, and crisp from the breading (some places there chicken like that is soggy and not very good). The refried beans are so yummy as well, I just wish they were a little thicker. The fried rice is amazing as well as the carnitas (I know I spelled that wrong) not dry or tough. The hype is real, if you haven't gone, do yourself a favor and do it.",2017-05-26 03:11:45

Pad woon sen:  2.5 out of 5 (by her reporting); she ordered ""combination: chicken, beef, and shrimp"" and received LITERALLY one (1) shrimp.  ONE.... The flavor of the noodles was great, she said, but there were way too many onions, carrots, and not enough meat.",2015-05-26 08:37:10

188,139,1.0,"Holy crap I am never doing this airline again! I know with budget airlines, you get what you pay for but this airline is beyond terrible and needs a lot of improvement. There are fees tacked on for everything and you have to be careful with what you are doing. This is my first time taking Allegiant and usually we take United Airlines. My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren't expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant's response was to ""do it yourself"". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude.

76,69,3.0,"This is my second visit; my first was back during CES in Jan. with a young friend visiting Vegas for the first time and who had never had a bloody mary...

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

Two stars or even one if not for the Bloody Mary meal or Jack Daniels chocolate cake.",2016-05-07 01:58:41
407,4,5.0,"Had our first experience with Casanova's on Sunday night and I was beyond impressed. I lived in NYC for 6 years and have turned in to some what of a pizza snob, always on the hunt for a pizza spot similar to ones in NYC. I finally found it! From their menu and toppings, to the experience at pick-up and then the actual pie itself, everything was excellent and of superior quality.

When I picked up the pie the woman behind the counter asked me if I was a new customer, she then shouted to the kitchen, using my name, that I was new and everyone cheered saying ""hi/welcome Tiffany"". She then offered me an order of free garlic knots to try as a first time customer. It definitely set the tone for what then was the best pizza I have found in Arizona, and quite frankly outside of NYC.

This is a must try and is now the only pizza place I will be ordering from.",2016-02-23 19:03:19

33,31,3.0,"The service was pretty bad. There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any. 

Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas. 

The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. 

One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. 

Definitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.",2013-10-03 08:38:38

If you do not have a huge appetite, I recommend splitting the meal if you come with someone else, which will lower the price significantly.  The reason why I did not give egg works a 5 star was because of the price, which unfortunately is consistent with all the other good breakfast establishments. If you don't mind taking a break from usual toast, please please please try out the banana nut muffin.  It is amazing.

I wasn't too hungry, but I could eat. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos--which were seasoned to perfection. So of course I was obliged to return. I came back the next day to get a burrito. Returned the next for a chimichanga.

619,142,2.0,"We knew we wanted ramen while in Vegas (hot soup in the desert? Oh, yeah), but didn't know where to go.

A fabulous-facial-haired Yelp buddy had written a stellar review of this place, and we knew this was the place to be. So, we made reservations (totally unnecessary) for lunch.

The place was pretty empty at noon on a Sunday, but filled up pretty quickly. We were seated, offered drinks, and ordered from the prix fixe menu.

+First course: Social House green salad with baby mesclun, tomato, and julienne slices of some root vegetable. It was dripping in the ginger dressing. It was tasty, but I wasn't interested in drinking my salad.

+Second course: Tonkotsu ramen, pork broth, a slab of pork, served with a soft-boiled egg and some fried garlic bits. The broth tasted kinda funny, so we added a splash of soy sauce for some flavor, broke open the yolk to add some creaminess, and sprinkled in the fried bits of garlic for some bite. It helped tremendously. I finished the entire bowl. Woo, proud member of the Clean Plate Club!

+Third course: spicy tuna cut roll. Here's where the problem lies: I don't know about you, but I cannot stand it when sushi has creamy ingredients added to it. Save the mayonnaise for sandwiches and the cream cheese for bagels. When I order sushi, I want simplicity; the flavors of the rice, nori, and fish must be able to stand alone, otherwise, I begin to wonder what you're trying to hide with that huge dollop of aioli. End rant. Anyway, with all that said, the sushi was NOT my favorite. Even the shrimp tempura cut roll had a ton of aioli added to the already-creamy avocado. What gives?

The service was great and the atmosphere was beautiful, but what's all that when the food isn't excellent, too?",2012-10-08 17:54:45

The beds are amazing and the room was tidy. The shower had adequate water pressure. They do serve Starbucks coffee downstairs in their cafe and have free wifi. They had multiple big screens in the lounge and so we were able to watch SNF( loved it)! The only bad experience we had was valet parking was $15 (which isn't bad for a location near a high venue spot) and I paid the bellman directly and then the next day it was added to my checkout bill- they did fix it right away!

There are fees tacked on for everything and you have to be careful with what you are doing. This is my first time taking Allegiant and usually we take United Airlines. My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren't expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant's response was to ""do it yourself"". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant.

152,122,2.0,"My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. 
I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences.

I've had several dishes, all of which are excellent. In my opinion, this is also the best Thai in Pittsburgh.

Shrimp Pad Thai is fantastic. Good portion eat in or take-out, with tons of big, juicy shrimp. The Cottage Wings are quite honestly the best wings I've had in Pittsburgh. I could probably eat 20+ of these things at a time. Everything I've eaten has been perfect.

The staff is also very welcoming. The taller lady (I think she may be the owner or manager) always greets us with a friendly smile, kind words, and excellent service. She seems to really be doing what she loves (and she's doing a great job). We have never waited for a table here, even with the place being as tiny as it is.

My girlfriend and I live close enough to walk to this place, and we do so on a fairly regular basis. It's our go-to if we want to stay local.

The only (small) complaints are as follows: They serve soda in cans, but this is sort of the modus operandi for a lot of Thai restaurants, so I can't really come down too hard on them for this one.

98,88,4.0,"Came here with a group of 20+ to see Morgan Page on 11/30/12.

Arrival: Got to the club around 11pm. Getting to the club was simple, took only around 15 minutes from the car to the lines (and that included a bit of pre-gaming)! 

Entry: Got my entire group on a guestlist with a 1:1 (guy/girl) comp until midnight. Sign up on their website and you will get a text back if you have been put on. The entry line was confusing as hell, with at least 4 different lines (staff, promoter, general, VIP). There was an open bar for ladies from 11-12 so things were a bit rushed. This came back to bite me in the ass as I made the mistake of leaving my guestlist line for the shorter staff entry line. Members of my group were with this female staff member who said could get us all free in even though our guy:girl ratio had more guys. I spoke with her personally to make sure of it before I left my line. Well...SHE LIED! The bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys:girls, leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry. My girlfriend was not pleased with the fact that one of my other group members (who came stag) got in for free and I didn't. Whatever, lesson learned. Don't rush in. Don't be tempted by an open bar or a shorter line. Stick with guestlist if you're approved. Make sure your group ratio is even or favors girls. Don't listen to otherwise!

Club Layout: The club itself is very nice. Not quite as grand or spacious as XS next door, but a beautiful venue nonetheless. Main dance floor is average sized. It was spacious enough so that we didn't feel like canned sardines and had adequate room to dance. There are no stairs or steps to climb, a la Marquee, so ladies will appreciate this. The main room is flanked by a large tent-like area and the outdoor wading pool/patio area. The easiest accessible restrooms are outside as well (the indoor one gets crowded). The outdoor area is ideal for those who want to socialize more, take pictures, take a breather, etc. It's beautiful.

Bar: The indoor bar layout is terrible. There was maybe 10 feet between the bar and the backs of the booths for those who got tables. This 10 feet also serves as the main walkway to get to the tent and outdoor area. Not so surprisingly, there is a lot of pushing, bouncers shining lights and telling you to move, and it worst of all: it takes forever to get a drink! I said before to not by tempted by an open bar for ladies and here's why: this is the only bar ladies can get free drinks from! On top of that, ladies can only get one drink at a time! So ladies, if you planned to be here for an hour and get drunk or pass drinks to the guys, you'll be disappointed.The outdoor bar nudged in between the tent/outdoor area is empty and stress-free compared to the one inside, so I would recommend buying drinks from here. Drinks were typical Vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per.

Overall, I had a great experience at Surrender. The club was beautiful, my group had a blast, and Morgan Page (and his opener) rocked it! Learn from my mistake, stay away from the indoor bar, and come with great people and you will have one memorable night! 4/5.",2012-12-04 07:49:34

130,35,3.0,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.",2015-04-01 13:34:47

The games are very, very affordable, which is awesome.  There are games from throughout the history of pinball, back to even when there were no flippers and you just watched the ball do its thing.  You really can't go wrong with this amazing establishment.  It's a ton of fun to try the different machines and experience pinball from various decades.  There is a great selection of video games too, plus weird old mechanical games such as baseball, including one where you use an air pump or something to propel a ball into the air and try to hit it with a mechanical doll.  Hilarious!!

68,63,3.0,"OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now.
Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one. 
Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.
Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.
Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this ""ironic""; I say, ""tacky!"" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting ""Go back to Denny's"", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal.
So, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price.",2014-02-05 18:14:36
487,99,3.0,"Adding another 'aye' attesting to the fabulousness of the burnt almond torte. 

The service, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. The young lady taking our order needs to either control her animosity towards customers, or consider bowing out of a career in the service industry. For one, don't hate us because we need you to place some pastries inside a paper bag. For another, hand our goods to us, without putting them on top of the glass displays, next to 2 similar bags with other people's orders. If I was interested in playing guessing games, I'd pick someone more personable to play with.

For the sake of the delicious baked goods, I'm going to give her the benefit of doubt and mention that it looked like she had a bad cold on the day we went in. Maybe she was just ill and not interested in being where she was at that point in time.",2011-09-25 19:53:40

Phillip was a great waiter and offered great suggestions and information regarding the menu.

If you let your waiter know that you are celebrating a special occasion, they will give you a free drink or dessert. We celebrated my friend's birthday there and got a free plate of mochi and fruity ice cream.

There is also the USS Requin exhibit that allows you to tour the submarine.  I had no idea that this was the US Navy's first Radar picket submarine! 

After you are done with the science center, walk on over to Sports Works! (it is included in the admission). It is so much fun but requires a lot of physical activity. Make sure you are wearing comfortable clothing as some of the exhibits require you bouncing or running.

If they maintain the service my friends and I received this last visit, this restaurant will be unstoppable.  This place is well priced for the product they provide!

Our server, Amy, was perfect.  She was pleasant, attentive and knowledgeable.  My friend is particular about his drinks and she answered all his questions- no problem.  My Moscow Mule was excellent.  She did proper follow ups with all of us if we wanted refills on our drinks.  We took a bit of time to pick our entrees because we were talking, and that was no problem.  She came back in timely intervals to see if we were ready to order.  She would walk by, check the table, and she could tell if everything was as it should be- so didn't feel the need to interrupt and ask.  There was a young man that kept our water topped off.

Our friends arrived before we did, and they were sensitive to another guest that smelled like the marlboro man himself- the owner gladly accommodated, reseating them in a booth between the bar and the trendy modern Japanese mural wall.  A nice conversation piece for the fans of modern Japanese culture and nerds alike.

Starters: Charred edamame, Ebiyaki, and Stellar Chips.  Easy to share amongst us.  
Cocktails: Moscow Mule, Apple Blossom x2, Sake (on tap).  
Entrees: Cedar Plank Salmon on Forbidden Rice, Sunshine Sushi Roll, Foo Burger, Crispy Rice Delight
Dessert: The Funkler (A nice finish on the meal)

Everything was properly seasoned, delicious, not over the top- per usual!  The food has always been creative and well prepared.  This visit just maintains that reputation with us.  Our friends loved it.  All of our plates left the table clean.  Doesn't matter if it comes from the kitchen or the sushi bar, it's very enjoyable.

The ambiance/environment is trendy, modern Japanese with chill upbeat music playing and martial arts films w/ subtitles playing silently on a few screens.  It just feels good to be in this space.  Very relaxed and comfortable. Balanced lighting.  A nice space to have some great conversation with some friends.

This restaurant use to struggle with service, but have always been on point with environment and food.  They really took the extra steps to move this in the right direction, and I'm pleased for it.  We'll be back again with more friends.

Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world!

Dan Dan noodles didn't contain one grain of pork, though not advertised as such, I generally get some pork love in my Dan Dan.  Noods arrived quite mushy, hence why I preferred the cold sesame.
Potstickers arrive in a way that I had not seen before - cooked as a sheet and with a crisp bottom - fascinating idea, but it prevented us from cleanly separating the dumplings from the rest, so filling got torn out.

82,74,2.0,"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.",2015-01-03 21:34:24

- some of the best chicken I've ever had
- some of the best pork I've ever had
- the best black beans I've ever had
- delicious Latin / Spanish style rice, and I am NOT a fan of this style of rice
- the best pepper sauce (a very potent green jalapeno / cilantro mixture)
- terrific tortillas, both flour and corn

The food works together so well, wrapping some of the marinated chicken or pork in a tortilla with the sauce, rice, and beans. I enjoyed the pork a bit more than the chicken, but both are best in class, succulent and juicy, spiced just right.",2008-12-03 10:58:55

There's not enough cheese and meat inside for my personal taste. I'm still left a little hungry after 8 inches. Otherwise the overall taste is great!

We ordered a variety of dishes: har cherng, sui mai, har gow, cha siu bao, etc.
Yuck. Not good at all.. (I forgot to take pictures because we were so hungry that we just dug into the food right away.) It didn't taste fresh, and the dumpling skin wasn't very soft. The sui mai looked OLD. I eat dim sum quite frequently and this was nowhere near the standards for dim sum in LA! 

The best thing was probably the boiled Chinese broccoli dish (which tastes the same everywhere) and cha siu bao (but I've still had better). Gr.. Eating such horrible dim sum just made me crave better Chinese food in LA. 

Service: It was difficult to find a server to refill our drinks and give us our check. However, the workers are friendly and

Came at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon and although there was no line to place an order, there was a 25 minute wait for the food.... I noticed that some people got their orders as soon as they showed up so I highly recommend ordering ahead by phone if thats possible.

The Gaucho Sandwich $15 was amazzzing with its wagyu tri tip steak and chimichuri sauce.  I would definitely order this again even though it's crazy expensive for just a sandwich.  

The Slut $10.50 on the other hand tasted like mash potatoes .  I did not care for this at all. 

For 2 sandwiches and a slut, I paid $37.  Pretty expensive but worth trying if you have not had it before AND if there is no wait.  Otherwise save the experience for another day.",2018-09-03 03:57:48

overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.

highlights: 
- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.
- Prime rib is excellent
- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.
- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

Avoid:
- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.
- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.",2010-01-08 04:28:23

Over $2,300 overall.  From the second we arrived at the dealership, we were accosted by a couple of overzealous salesmen, who started talking out ears off about trading in our Rav for a brand new one, which we made clear we weren't going to do. Even when we made this clear, they still gave us their business card and talked our ears off some more. Turn the corner, and BAM! Another salesman, ANOTHER pitch to trade in our Rav. My mother and I were walking around, looking for bottled water, which this dealership has offered us before for free. We were directed towards a vending machine where you have to pay for it. Really? It's 100+ degrees outside and they don't even offer customers a complimentary water bottle to quench their thirst? Disappointed in Right Toyota.

287,154,3.0,"We entertained clients there.  It's a great location and certainly a trendy night spot.  I give kudos to the hostesses for helping us pull together several tables and being patient while we waited for our colleagues to arrive after they got lost.

Sort of strange though how we would order drinks from our server and each time they would get delivered it would be a different server and we kept having to tell the drink delivery person who ordered what.  

Personally the drinks are overpriced at $9 for Bombay Gin for example.   My co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  Likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.

The food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location I really expected more.  Two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  The sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but I thought my salmon was really overcooked.  Again, it wasn't bad, but I expected more.

I probably wouldn't go back, as when I travel I like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn't give me a good vibe I just move on to discover something else.  I wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the ""trendy place to go"" and not because the food was outstanding. 

 Again, I think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.  I would expect than at a place for beer specials and not an average of $9 bucks a pop.",2011-03-20 00:22:46

Probably some of  the worst service I have received. At least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile, you come back and explain and/or apologize. Instead, we were left wondering and waiting for our food. Obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us. You would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check, but no, nothing.

I love the feel and the idea of the greenery and artifacts in the back which give for great after-ceremony photos (exactly what most of the venues in the city are missing). My biggest gripe is with their 'soft holds policy'. Personally, I have no issues with this. So, after touring on a Saturday and falling in love, I tell them my fiancé and I will be back the next weekend with family because we want to lock down our October date that is still open. They tell us thats great, set an appointment, but again make it clear they cannot do a 'soft hold'. 

The following Saturday 9 of us show up. Tell them we're probably going to book, and they mention another bride is INTERESTED...There are no soft holds though, so it shouldn't matter-right? So while I'M there touring with my family, the owner calls the other bride telling her there is someone else touring that is REALLY interested (I witnessed the call first-hand when I walked in to their office to ask for pricing to show my dad whom hadn't seen it). The owner is on the phone for a long while, and comes back to say 'the other bride is on her way down (!!!!!) but it's whoever gets the money in our hand first that gets the date, since we don't do soft holds'. When my dad says alright, we're ready, the owner says 'I don't want you making a rash decision because you feel pressure'. 

At this point I'm almost ready to cry out of pure frustration, and tell the owner point blank, 'If we walk out now so you can talk to the other bride, we will not be back'. 

Ultimately we got the date we wanted, and the other bride got her secondary date, and came over to congratulate us after booking. Kudos to the other bride, but hopefully The Castle owners will provide for a better experience going forward and not make us regret investing thousands in this place. 

Will update as things progress, and hopefully be able to increase the stars because I do think the place is absolutely stunning.",2013-12-07 02:44:34

540,281,5.0,"I try to approach food reviews with a bowl full of practicality.  After all, it's just food right?  Someone makes it for you.  You eat it.  It goes to your stomach and you get full.  The collection of tastes, regardless of magnificence, are quickly filed into your culinary memory shortly after you pay and go on your merry way, reserving a moment to determine the probability of your return.
  
Café Monarch is a place where you can go to eat.   A restaurant by definition.   But to simply lump it into that broad classification is criminal.  Mind you, I despise flowery, over-hyped statements seemingly assigned to all things food (and wine) but this place is so much more than a restaurant.  It left me  desperately trying to grasp and hold the sensations of food, wine, atmosphere, music, service, comfort and how they all seemed to work in harmony to make our visit remarkable.   I'm a practical man and mostly grown up.  I try not to get caught up in hype or revel in the splendor of things like froe gras and Manila clam chowder or something called a Winter Salad which were all among best things I've ever put in my mouth.  But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.  

You will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.  

The lofty recommendation to visit Café Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression.",2017-01-27 20:52:48

130,35,3.0,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.",2015-04-01 13:34:47

789,24,4.0,"I guess it's just as good as you'd expect! Tried the carving station, had a huge pile of crab legs, and a custom omelet. I have a bit of a gripe about the omelets...my fiance and I made it a point to get here before breakfast service ended precisely because I wanted to hit the omelet bar. We got in with about 30 minutes of breakfast service left, and when I got to the omelet station they were already breaking it down and getting ready for lunch. There was only the standard ""huge platter filled with scrambled eggs sitting over a sterno can."" I was annoyed...I complained ""I didn't pay all that money to eat pre-made eggs sitting under a heat lamp!"" Now, I'll give the guy credit...he said ""I'll make you whatever you want"" and so I still got my omelet! That was the right thing to do and I appreciated it. But it seems like I shouldn't have had to complain...most people wouldn't have said anything and would have just walked away disappointed. They should find a way to keep the station open right up until the end of the breakfast service.

Besides that, nothing but good things to say. I had a fantastic mimosa and made myself some sliders on rolls with the meats from the carving station, which were amazingly tender. The crab legs were the sweetest I've ever had...I think the snow crab was a little better than the king crab.

Great pastries. We had a sampling of them for dessert.",2012-04-28 17:04:57

Chada has a massive menu with some seriously good dishes at incredibly reasonable prices. 

Our server recommended four dishes, we ordered them all, I regret nothing.

Crispy beef (Moo Kham Whan) was mouth-wateringly flavorful, super crispy and fresh. Heavily seasoned with cilantro, lime, mint, chili and red onion.

Crab curry--takes like ocean-flavored red curry. And with little nests of vermicelli noodles, it's a must-try. 

Grilled pork with spicy chili sauce (Pla Nua Tod) and the sauteed mushrooms with brussels sprouts (Pad Hed) were also very good. 

I really can't recommend this place enough.",2013-12-07 01:43:16

634,190,5.0,"This was my first experience to Melt and I have to say it was awesome.  Everything was fantastic, and I will explain... my buddy and I went for a late lunch today (Monday) and there was only a few people there, so for me it was perfect since I am not a fan of crowds.  Next, the decorations are creative, fun and playful... and I had never thought to use holiday light sculptures as a decoration other than a yard ornament, but it is looks great and works for the space.  The server was excellent and attentive; he came back to the table at least 4 or 5 times, and repeatedly refilled our drinks, made sure we were doing okay, asked if we needed anything... wonderful service.  I ate the El Diablo, which was great... really spicy, but I like to sweat and tear up when eating tasty things.  It brought a tear to my eye; but in a good way.  The burger was spicier than I expected which caught me off guard... loved every minute of it.  The quality of food was excellent and matched with the quantity, which was very filling.  The menu had so many things I wanted to try.  The beer list looked great, but need a designated driver for next time.  There appeared to be a variety of root beer options, so a variety of root beer flavors?  Every thing I am writing is leading me to one conclusion, and that is I am going to go back to try different things, and share this fun atmosphere and great customer service experience with my wife.

Last time we went there, and it was the last time ever, it took our waitress 25 minutes to pick the check up off the table and return it. It became a running joke at our table of how long it would take her. To be fair, I can understand this type of wait when it's busy, but we noticed that the waitress only had 3 tables at the time.

Tip - Make sure to get on open table and make a reservation if you plan to eat at a specific time. The dinning room section isn't huge and can fill up fast. When we walked in at 8:30 on a Friday night, it was a 1.5 hour wait. 
We ordered the Shrimp and grits, Chicken, Waffles and Watermelon, side of Mac n' Cheese, order of deviled eggs, and order of biscuits. let's just say we over did it....considering this was food for four people.

We had a 7pm reservation, called in 4 days in advance, and we were seated at 8pm with no menus, no bread, no wine, except us whining that we felt like this was an episode of ""Hells Kitchen"".  

We had to laugh (group of 6) and we were not in a hurry, yet we had to ask for everything, server, wine, another wine, ect...  We finally got bread at 8:22pm, and after the bread the salad, and steaks came out pretty quick, but they could not figure out who's steak was who's...and the three women's steaks were all delivered to the wrong person, one had to be sent back, ordered M.R. brought M.W., not good...brought a new steak Rare...and the same person got shorted wine from the person as they tried to pour to all six  of us from a bottle of wine brought to the table uncorked with the cork in the bottle, not good...

All of that on our first visit ever to DC, and they did not offer us anything for compensation, no offer, no nothing...""sorry we are still learning""...""thanks for your patience""...""It's been overwhelming"" told to us by our server...

It's really too bad, nice place, nice people, my steak was perfect and I love the fact that they serve every steak with sauteed mushrooms...love em, and the price point of the menu is right on...Wine list could be better especially for a ""Steakhouse"" they are competing with some heavy hitters in the Southeast Valley, they better step it up a bit...

580,35,4.0,"Does another Memorial Day have to be another drive to the coast or the mountains? Do we really have to, yet again, find an ocean side city or a bay to to enjoy an urban weekend? I struggled for weeks because I just couldn't deal with driving 10 miles an hour in a 45 or 55 MPH zone behind cyclists riding three across on a state highway. I couldn't imagine trying to enjoy a walk while bicycles fly by me at 20 MPH. What to do? I've always been contemptuous of Las Vegas, But I'm also sick of coming home after a weekend away more stressed than when I left because of speeding up and slowing down for bicycles, rounding a curve and slamming on my brakes for cyclists riding two or three across,  and getting flipped off half the time. 

I opened my mind and accepted the Venetian as an alternative. After several visits for conferences or meetings, I knew that the canal was a pleasant place to enjoy a walk and stop for dinner, so I took the plunge and did something different. It was the best move I've ever made. After just an evening I realized just how much having to dealing with bicycles everywhere else degrades the experience and the general quality of life.

Table prices are good and service is decent.  The bouncers are cool and VIP is roped off.  Tables are big and tons of space if you get the side tables on the wall.

This being said, I am growing tired of buffets. It is a casual and cheap dining experience which can be good if I did too much shopping or gambling and my wallet is in pain. But aside from that, there are so many amazing restaurants to try - if I am not feeling broke I don't think I will return to a buffet unless a friend drags me. 

However, Bellagio buffet is the best food I have found at any buffet I have ever had in my life. So if you are going to buffet, I would say this is the place to do so.

My favorite were crab-legs, roast beef cuts, avocado, and fish. Desserts were delightful and satisfied my sweet tooth (3 times). Recommended is the Vanilla ice cream (non-soft serve). Very creamy and soothing.",2011-04-22 02:35:32

On the plus side, happy hour is decent at half price appetizers, free chips & salsa and cheap drinks. I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend. 

Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.

The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front. 

We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food. 

Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Service was horrible, but they didn't even seem that busy.

We would have ended up spending a lot more $ here on food and drinks but decided to go other places in old town to get good service.

Management...please take the helpful hints, because I know you can be a good restaurant.",2011-06-29 03:59:57

540,281,5.0,"I try to approach food reviews with a bowl full of practicality.  After all, it's just food right?  Someone makes it for you.  You eat it.  It goes to your stomach and you get full.  The collection of tastes, regardless of magnificence, are quickly filed into your culinary memory shortly after you pay and go on your merry way, reserving a moment to determine the probability of your return.
  
Café Monarch is a place where you can go to eat.   A restaurant by definition.   But to simply lump it into that broad classification is criminal.  Mind you, I despise flowery, over-hyped statements seemingly assigned to all things food (and wine) but this place is so much more than a restaurant.  It left me  desperately trying to grasp and hold the sensations of food, wine, atmosphere, music, service, comfort and how they all seemed to work in harmony to make our visit remarkable.   I'm a practical man and mostly grown up.  I try not to get caught up in hype or revel in the splendor of things like froe gras and Manila clam chowder or something called a Winter Salad which were all among best things I've ever put in my mouth.  But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.  

You will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.  

The lofty recommendation to visit Café Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression.",2017-01-27 20:52:48

The taste was perfect and it had the right texture color and consistency. This is not a vegi garden burger. I love to cook and have no idea how they do this. Just try it and you will be shocked! I opted to remove the middle bun and it was just like a double patty with cheese and toppings. I would never have guessed it was vegan. MUST TRY! The fries were crispy and fresh.

287,154,3.0,"We entertained clients there.  It's a great location and certainly a trendy night spot.  I give kudos to the hostesses for helping us pull together several tables and being patient while we waited for our colleagues to arrive after they got lost.

Sort of strange though how we would order drinks from our server and each time they would get delivered it would be a different server and we kept having to tell the drink delivery person who ordered what.  

Personally the drinks are overpriced at $9 for Bombay Gin for example.   My co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  Likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.

The food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location I really expected more.  Two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  The sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but I thought my salmon was really overcooked.  Again, it wasn't bad, but I expected more.

I probably wouldn't go back, as when I travel I like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn't give me a good vibe I just move on to discover something else.  I wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the ""trendy place to go"" and not because the food was outstanding. 

 Again, I think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.  I would expect than at a place for beer specials and not an average of $9 bucks a pop.",2011-03-20 00:22:46

I try to be as impartial as possible when trying a new place, but I'm not quite sure what's going on with this place. We arrived around 12:30pm and expected a lunch rush. The place was mostly empty, maybe 6 tables out of 17 had customers dining. With two other parties in front of us, we were told we had to put our names on a list and wait to be seated. It only took 5 minutes to be seated, but given that so many tables were empty, waiting at all seemed odd. 

The hostess is very friendly and delivered menus and took our order quickly. We ordered pho and a bahn mi sandwich and were given the usual plate of condiments to go with it, but it was missing the Thai basil and cilantro. When we asked about it, the server said they recently started omitting these items from the plate and only served them if customers asked. So that is a little weird to me too. 

My dining companion was served her soup several minutes before my sandwich came out, which is also when the iced coffee I had ordered at the start came out. Also weird. 

But as for the food, the bahn mi sandwich rolls are HUGE. Like...American football sized. And they are GOOD! They were a little skimpy on the jalapeños, but I understand not everyone has a mouth made of asbestos like mine. 

All in all worth it for the food, but the service is just a little weird, which is the only reason for the 3 stars.",2018-03-15 20:33:03

130,35,3.0,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

I may offend many people, but we were very disappointed.  We ordered a few different items so we could try it all, but we didn't LOVE any of them.  Here's what we ordered (all in the large size)...

cheesesteak sandwich:  way too rich and ""Velveeta cheesy"" for our taste 

meatball sub:  it was okay, the marinara was the best part

fettucini alfredo w/ chicken:  bland sauce

calzone:  honestly can't give a review of this other than it was humongous!  it came out later than our other food, so we were too stuffed with the other dishes, that we just gave the entire thing to the valet attendant at our resort.",2013-08-03 20:59:50

Chada has a massive menu with some seriously good dishes at incredibly reasonable prices. 

Our server recommended four dishes, we ordered them all, I regret nothing.

Crispy beef (Moo Kham Whan) was mouth-wateringly flavorful, super crispy and fresh. Heavily seasoned with cilantro, lime, mint, chili and red onion.

Crab curry--takes like ocean-flavored red curry. And with little nests of vermicelli noodles, it's a must-try. 

Grilled pork with spicy chili sauce (Pla Nua Tod) and the sauteed mushrooms with brussels sprouts (Pad Hed) were also very good.

My husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  I'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  The entrees that we ordered were the Jambalaya and the Short Rib Stew.  The Jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.  It seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert I have had in a long time.

Yardbird's specialty is their fried chicken. The kind waitress explained how the chicken is brined for 25 hours and flash fried in 3 minutes - quite impressive numbers! I guess bottom line: you get what you paid for. Chicken was delicious and moist on the inside, but for $26 for 4 pieces of chicken, I highly doubt I'll return for seconds. That's $7 for each piece! Ouch.

876,193,5.0,"Wow. Wow Freakin' Wow.

I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER. 

I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.

I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.

When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!

The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.

We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.

But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.

Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.

For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.

Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) 

It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.

Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through. 

The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)

592,299,5.0,"Wow can I be more impressed? First of all, if you are a ramen enthusiast, then you have heard about shin sen gumi ramen from LA j-town. Shin-sen-gumi is the crown of ramen on the west coast, so to be able to go up against shin sen gumi is something to be proud off. The tonkatsu ramen soup here taste almost identical to shin sen gumi and I was blown away. Most establishments have really salty or weird flavor soup base like adding butter and garlic for a more western tongue (names I would not mention). The noodle here is the thin style but was a bit more soft compared to shin.  The owner said he could make it more chewy if I wanted to since everything is made by him including the noodles. He also said that his ramen has no added msg or preservative which is surprising to hear. I mean what? Asian food with no msg = mind blown.

Now for the con, the chashu and egg is very average. Here I feel the meat isn't marinated as much and not as sweet. The egg is bland as well like a hard boiled egg, maybe that was the intention to accentuate the flavor of the soup. The place needs more tables also. 

So why did I give 5 stars, based on the soup, noodle, and no msg, this place is on par with shin sen gumi. I support local family business and no longer need to go to la for good ramen. This will be my primary spot from now on.",2017-10-24 20:47:11

You should be able to go everywhere with water bottles, this is a safety issue. When I tried to explain this to the security guard, he made me throw it in the trash. (When I later got into my bay, one of the bays next to us was passing a flask around.) That didn't give me a very good first impression of the business and I hadn't even made it in the door yet. 

I ordered a membership card online prior to arriving because I was told that it would be easier than waiting in line to buy one there. I still had to wait in line to pick it up and when I did, they had no record of my purchase. When I showed them my receipt email on my phone, the receipt that was sent to me was for another person. I spoke with a manager and forwarded him the emails so that he could send it to corporate to investigate. Safe to say, I'm a bit nervous that they can't keep receipts straight in email I'm worried about them having my credit card information.

I've had several dishes, all of which are excellent. In my opinion, this is also the best Thai in Pittsburgh.

Shrimp Pad Thai is fantastic. Good portion eat in or take-out, with tons of big, juicy shrimp. The Cottage Wings are quite honestly the best wings I've had in Pittsburgh. I could probably eat 20+ of these things at a time. Everything I've eaten has been perfect.

The staff is also very welcoming. The taller lady (I think she may be the owner or manager) always greets us with a friendly smile, kind words, and excellent service.

My girlfriend and I live close enough to walk to this place, and we do so on a fairly regular basis. It's our go-to if we want to stay local.

The only (small) complaints are as follows: They serve soda in cans, but this is sort of the modus operandi for a lot of Thai restaurants, so I can't really come down too hard on them for this one.

The bathroom is very large and they've got TVs in the bathroom, bedroom, and living room area.  I also like that their sunken living rooms as it makes the room feel even larger. They've got a great selection of shops and restaurants including Bouchon Bakery which makes awesome pastries and Parisian Macaroons.  How the Venetian scored this place instead of Paris Hotel is certainly a mystery, but it sure makes the Venetian a better choice!  Pool area is set up like a typical European Garden.  Wish they had real grass instead of turf as that is really hot to walk in during the summer.  Also, the one large pool gets very crowded which made me question the cleanliness of the water, but it was fairly relaxing regardless.  It's nice that they have various areas with beach chairs that are smaller so you don't feel like your at the pool with 1,000 people even though you are.  They put a lot of thought into the architecture of the place as it is very Italian, and very romantic.  The check-in staff was great and upgraded us from a smaller suite to a larger one for free.

We shared a handful of oysters with a mild jalapeño sauce. They could have been a bit briny-ier for my taste. And for entrees, we hit opposite ends of the taste spectrum: I had the pork carnitas, which was mild and sweet, with avocado, cole slaw, and a corn 'pancake,' with only a bit of red onion to balance it out. My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned.

402,240,2.0,"I just returned from picking up our takeout with my son, and I have to say the experience was some of the worst service I've experienced in Madison.  When I called to order the server was almost reluctant to give me the balance, and then abruptly hung up.  

When my son and I arrived at the restaurant we had three servers pass us, ignore us, and then waited 2 minutes for a server to get off the phone before asking us what we wanted, as if it was an inconvenience.  I am a single mother and was trying to buy something as a Memorial Day indulgence but not break the bank.  The amount of food we received for the 1/3 slab and pulled pork sandwich was laughable.  If you are going to charge $15 for that, then at least have the decency to provide good sides and in something larger than a condiment cup that the Mexican place down the road uses for their sour cream.  

 I am not sure how people rate this place so highly; my suspicion is that the meat is very well done, while the rest of the business languishes.  I have eaten all over the world and in any international city this business would fail.

There are fees tacked on for everything and you have to be careful with what you are doing. This is my first time taking Allegiant and usually we take United Airlines. My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren't expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant's response was to ""do it yourself"". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant.

It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer.

891,112,2.0,"After reading all these reviews for ""Cleveland's Best New Restaurant"", we had such high hopes for Butcher & The Brewer. Man, were we disappointed.

Let me tell you, I was not expecting to have AMAZING service, especially in a restaurant as big and as packed as this place (and since I am a server myself, I feel for these people running around like crazy) and we did go on a night with two concerts and a home Indians game. My boyfriend and I met up with some family friends of his and right when we sat down our waitress showed up to take our drink orders. I love beer, but seeing ""Draft Wine"" on the menu made my heart pitter-patter. My boyfriend stuck with the Farmhouse Rouge, while our friend ordered the Le Boucher and four appetizers for us to share right off the bat. This is, sadly, where things began to go downhill. My boyfriend's beer came out in a regular 12 oz. glass and it was a bright orange-y yellow color. The menu said that the Farmhouse Rouge was an amber, and I even commented how brightly colored it was, but continued sipping my DRAFT WINE (still excited about this). It was also a little hoppy for his taste at first, but the more he drank the more he enjoyed it. Our friend's Le Boucher was a deep maroon color that came in a smaller snifter glass. One by one, our appetizers arrived. The sliders, while a tad overcooked, were delicious thanks to the brioche bun and the spicy mayo. The corndogs were also delicious, no carnival wieners here. The whole wings (which were just okay) were brought out to us by our actual waitress, not a food runner, so we asked about our fourth and final appetizer we were waiting on, the one we were all the most excited about: the bone marrow. She said she would gladly go and check on it for us and that it should be up any minute. Well, that any minute soon turned into 20 minutes. Then 25 minutes. Our waitress came back to see if we needed any drinks, with no last appetizer in her hands. Our friend asked about the bone marrow AGAIN, and changed his beer to a Farmhouse Rouge, which my boyfriend ordered again and I ordered another glass of wine. 

Now things just get a little strange. The waitress comes back and tells us that they are out of bone marrow and have been all night. Considering we ordered the appetizers almost an hour prior and we were just being told this right then after asking about it several times, we were a little iffy. But mistakes do happen, and she said she would buy us the round of drinks we were waiting on for the trouble. In comes my wine, and then in comes the two snifters of a marooney, dark Farmhouse Rouge. WAIT, WHAT?? Right as she puts his glass down, my boyfriend looks at her and says, ""Wait, we both ordered the Farmhouse Rouge?"" and, kind of in a snotty tone, she replies, ""Yeaaaah, that's what this is."" Since he had ordered it before and this obviously was a completely different beer in color, taste, even glass it was served in, he asks what the first beer he was served actually was. She says she's not sure and walks away. Okay then? Today, we still have no idea what beer he drank when we arrived there. It will forever be a mystery. 

We decided to order entrees as well, and all I can say is stay away from the shrimp and grits. The grits, the poached egg, and the large pieces of pork belly were delicious on their own, but they couldn't save the dish from the very fishy shrimp. Instead of being plump and sweet, they tasted almost like shrimp cocktail, the kind you can tell aren't fresh and were probably frozen a while ago. For a $16 price tag, it just wasn't worth it. Come to this establishment for the beer (if you are actually served the one you order), the draft wine (STILL YAY!), and an appetizer, but don't expect stellar service or seafood for the price. Probably won't be returning or recommending it any time soon, and that makes me sad.",2015-07-28 15:04:07

The ice cream is made in house it's NOT soft serve. There are comfortable booths and tv screens in there. The bathrooms are located OUTSIDE. Ask for directions. It was good. For the 3 of us it was $81 just to give you an idea

955,305,3.0,"Wanted to try somewhere new for breakfast. After reading reviews we decided to give it a go. Walking in you can smell all the different kinds of food. It smelt wonderful. It was seat yourself, which was easy. It was a little crowed and loud like a cafeteria. We waited for like 10 minutes for someone to finally acknowledge us to take our drink order and since we had time to look over the menu we where able to order our food. It seemed like it took awhile for us to get our food. 

We ordered the French toast with a side of sausage links. Two eggs with bacon/sliced tomato with everything bagel. The people you sat down long after us order two sandwiches and they got their food quicker than us. The food was great. Eggs were perfect and not just put together real fast. French toast had four huge pieces. I order the everything bagel, it would have been good if they didn't burn the top. The food was great. 

The services was just horrible. And not even worth it. When we finished we waited for our server to come with the check and we waited around 15 minutes for her to come. We never got any refills or even check on to make sure things were good. It was hard to even get someone's attention. Three stars for service. Otherwise would have given five. Might go back, but order carry out instead.",2013-12-07 21:38:15
621,252,5.0,"This is a TRUE five start restaurant. Our party of three was two out-of-towners and one local who was new to the area. We had El Chorro recommended to us by friends in Mesa. A short wait at the bar and we were seated on the patio and had a great server.

We had short ribs, seafood pasta and trout almondine with mussels for an appetizer. The seafood pasta and mussels were a bit overkill on seafood, but I am a seafood lover and loved it all. 

The new Paradise Valley member of our group (fresh out of college) loved it as well as us older folks and plans to return as soon as she can. All and all a wonderful evening out. We have added it to our must visit in Phoenix list.",2015-04-01 17:35:29

540,281,5.0,"I try to approach food reviews with a bowl full of practicality.  After all, it's just food right?  Someone makes it for you.  You eat it.  It goes to your stomach and you get full.  The collection of tastes, regardless of magnificence, are quickly filed into your culinary memory shortly after you pay and go on your merry way, reserving a moment to determine the probability of your return.
  
Café Monarch is a place where you can go to eat.   A restaurant by definition.   But to simply lump it into that broad classification is criminal.  Mind you, I despise flowery, over-hyped statements seemingly assigned to all things food (and wine) but this place is so much more than a restaurant.  It left me  desperately trying to grasp and hold the sensations of food, wine, atmosphere, music, service, comfort and how they all seemed to work in harmony to make our visit remarkable.   I'm a practical man and mostly grown up.  I try not to get caught up in hype or revel in the splendor of things like froe gras and Manila clam chowder or something called a Winter Salad which were all among best things I've ever put in my mouth.  But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.  

You will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.  

The lofty recommendation to visit Café Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression.",2017-01-27 20:52:48
734,157,1.0,This place is awful! When my boyfriend and I  sat down it took our server 15 mins just to greet us(meanwhile we were sitting right in front of the kitchen and could see that she was just taking her sweet time) then took another 15 mins just to get salad and breadsticks on our table. Our server never came and checked on us to see how we were doing once we got our food (our food wasn't very good) or if we needed anything! I had to be the one to flag her down and get something. I also heard her talking to her manager and she only had 2 tables!!! Us and the table next to us and basically ignored us the whole time. I don't know if she was busy or stressed but if that was the case she shouldn't be working there! I will never be back to this location! So sad!,2015-02-02 07:03:57

For just opening, lettuce should have been fresh. Then we waited another 30 mins for our entrees. Steak was decent, nothing to write home about. Potato was pretty blah. Definitely not worth the money. Then found out on our bill that choosing a cesar side salad instead of mixed greens is additional $4/salad. Ridiculous. Waiter should have told us that.

188,139,1.0,"Holy crap I am never doing this airline again! I know with budget airlines, you get what you pay for but this airline is beyond terrible and needs a lot of improvement. There are fees tacked on for everything and you have to be careful with what you are doing. This is my first time taking Allegiant and usually we take United Airlines. My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren't expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant's response was to ""do it yourself"". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude.

The beds are amazing and the room was tidy. The shower had adequate water pressure. They do serve Starbucks coffee downstairs in their cafe and have free wifi. They had multiple big screens in the lounge and so we were able to watch SNF( loved it)! The only bad experience we had was valet parking was $15 (which isn't bad for a location near a high venue spot) and I paid the bellman directly and then the next day it was added to my checkout bill- they did fix it right away!

740,325,5.0,"Happy Dog is Cleveland's answer to Chicago's Hot Doug's. One thing- hot dogs, done up in thousands of different combinations with various toppings, condiments and sauces, from the everyday to the exotic. 

My first time here, I went with the suggested combination of Korean ingredients including cucumbers, kimchi and chili paste. My dog, was this delicious! As another reviewer mentioned, the bun became soggy and inedible very fast and normally that would be enough to shave off a star, if not two, right? In this case, not so much because the spicy, vinegary Korean toppings and the perfectly done all beef dog was one of the most sublime flavor profiles I've experienced. My wife had a dog with a Mexican mole theme and it was just as mouth wateringly tasty - with less collateral damage on the bun to boot!

The fries and tots here are both amazing - be sure to pick out some interesting sauce for those as well. 

It should be no surprise the food here is so good as this is partly the brainchild of Momocho's Eric Williams.

I should have listened. There was one table with 2 people at it, at 9pm at night, that should have told us everything. We stood up front waiting to be seated, there was no one around to seat us. Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn't smile, didn't say I'll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw). Imagine when walked in we were greeted and told they would be right with us. The manager saw us and immediately went to try and seat us while he was in the middle of something.

The biscuits were fluffy , grits cooked just right , and eggs cooked perfectly could have used another one . We will be coming back and looking forward to trying other things .

Goat cheese, pork belly, puréed garlic! Sign me up! We recently found ourselves on that side of town (directly across from the Knights baseball stadium) so we knew we had to go. This place is tucked into an alley so Street parking isn't all that easy; I recommend going ahead and parking in the parking deck. The restaurant is very small and you order your pizza pretty much the same way you order from Subway or Moe's. Everything is right in front of you and they just pile it on...my husband got the meat eater and it's pretty normal- nothing out of the ordinary there but why go to a place like this and get something you can get anywhere?! That's like going to Baskin Robbins and getting vanilla! I settled on the Southern Comfort...a sweeter Alfredo sauce, cheese, basil, pork belly and corn. Added caramelized  onions and the girl making the pizza suggested I put some Italian sausage on it - sure why not! She also said ""I know this is gonna sound strange but when it's done, let me drizzle some honey on two pieces and see if you like it"" Honey? On a Pizza? Ok, I'm game...what a game changer! Omg!

I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.

When you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! 

Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!

Do yourself a favor, plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom, have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit, then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires!

My favorite Cirque show for a variety of skill and acrobatics is Mystere.  Ka had more of a story, some acorbatics and a great giant floating stage, Oh involved a lot of water with acrobats diving into the pool. All the shows I mentioned the music was forgettable cirque gibberish.  The music is the star of the Love show and since both my kids like the Beatles it was money well spent. The staging lighting, sound was impressive  and it all correlated to the song.  If you are not a big  Beatles fan I'd stay away.  I can understand why some are disappointed as I too thought it could use more jaw dropping acrobatics.  I kept waiting for some of the performers bouncing around on bungees to do something but they never did.  I was thinkning 'heck I can do that!'

249,51,4.0,"Platinum Hotel is a nice hotel.  The rooms are clean, and the place lacks all the smoke and noise of the hotels that are closer to the strip.  For some people this is a good thing, but for those looking forward to being able to gamble and whatnot till 4AM in the morning and then take an elevator to your room to rest, try elsewhere.  Besides that though, this place is great.

My only gripe with this hotel was one involving me reserving 2 Queen/Solitaire Suite with (2) Queen Beds, but when I got there they only had the (2) suites with (1) King Bed each.  I spoke with them and called in for the pull in beds and it also helped that the couch was also a pull out too, so that served our needs.  So, all in all, wasn't a deal breaker.  

I did like the suites though for the most part, bathroom was huge, Kitchen came stocked with glasses, silverware, and small appliances, no pots or pans, but it didn't matter.  Although we didn't use it that much, it was nice to have it available to us if we did.

249,51,4.0,"Platinum Hotel is a nice hotel.  The rooms are clean, and the place lacks all the smoke and noise of the hotels that are closer to the strip.  For some people this is a good thing, but for those looking forward to being able to gamble and whatnot till 4AM in the morning and then take an elevator to your room to rest, try elsewhere.  Besides that though, this place is great.

My only gripe with this hotel was one involving me reserving 2 Queen/Solitaire Suite with (2) Queen Beds, but when I got there they only had the (2) suites with (1) King Bed each.  I spoke with them and called in for the pull in beds and it also helped that the couch was also a pull out too, so that served our needs.  So, all in all, wasn't a deal breaker.  

I did like the suites though for the most part, bathroom was huge, Kitchen came stocked with glasses, silverware, and small appliances, no pots or pans, but it didn't matter.  Although we didn't use it that much, it was nice to have it available to us if we did.

970,359,4.0,"Probably the most decent place for macarons in Markham.  It's a small shop but the ambiance is aighhht for relaxation and conversation.  The Earl Grey and Lychee Rose are the BEST flavours there.  Everything from its size, flavour, colour, presentation, and even sandwich ratio was perfect (compared to other Markham shops).  The prices vary by flavour but each piece can run from $2.25-$2.50 (no tax on half dozen).  So if you can't afford to fly to Paris or New York or you're too lazy to drive down to Nadege, take my advice and visit Ruelo.  This place serves cakes, coffee, and high tea as well if you're craving something different. The coffee isn't the greatest but when you pair it with something as delectable as the pistachio macaron, you won't even notice.

EDIT - Jun 14/11 - I finally had the chance to try the Wasabi Grapefruit macaron.  They never seemed to have it when I go, but this time I was lucky enough to grab one.

222,162,1.0,"With so many wonderful restaurants there is no reason to come here.
I will never come back.
Service was bad, food was bad (except the soup), atmosphere was nice although it opens into the slot machines at Luxor.

If you sit at the bar, there is a huge pillar with a flat screen, which is great for watching sports, but hides you away from the bartender if you sit to the righthand side.  
I had to get up and get his attention because he couldn't see me.
The girl that sat down next to me actually moved to one of the tables in the lounge because the service was so bad (she did get great service from the cocktail waitress though).

The Wild Mushroom soup was amazing, that is why the restaurant gets a star.  Have the soup, then go somewhere else for the main course.

The steak I ordered was tasteless, I had to order a side of bearnaise sauce to get it down and I love steak; I would eat steak everyday if I could, but not from here even if it was free (which it definately wasn't).  And the bearnaise was tasteless as well.  If I hadn't enjoyed the soup so much I would have thought something was wrong with my sense of taste.

The wine also tasted like it had been opened the day before or maybe even the day before that.  I'm not a wine snob, but it was like vinegar.  The bartender didn't even bother pouring a little for himself to see if it had gone bad.
This was the first time in my life I had to refuse a glass of wine.",2010-07-07 20:11:53
824,35,5.0,"By far my favorite place to stay in Vegas to this date.  I've stayed at other hotels including Encore and would rather stay here.  Their ""all suites"" rooms are seriously awesome.  The bathroom is very large and they've got TVs in the bathroom, bedroom, and living room area.  I also like that their sunken living rooms as it makes the room feel even larger. They've got a great selection of shops and restaurants including Bouchon Bakery which makes awesome pastries and Parisian Macaroons.  How the Venetian scored this place instead of Paris Hotel is certainly a mystery, but it sure makes the Venetian a better choice!  Pool area is set up like a typical European Garden.  Wish they had real grass instead of turf as that is really hot to walk in during the summer.  Also, the one large pool gets very crowded which made me question the cleanliness of the water, but it was fairly relaxing regardless.  It's nice that they have various areas with beach chairs that are smaller so you don't feel like your at the pool with 1,000 people even though you are.  They put a lot of thought into the architecture of the place as it is very Italian, and very romantic.  The check-in staff was great and upgraded us from a smaller suite to a larger one for free.

The waitstaff here was spot on, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was beautiful...felt like you were in a little eatery in Italy.

592,299,5.0,"Wow can I be more impressed? First of all, if you are a ramen enthusiast, then you have heard about shin sen gumi ramen from LA j-town. Shin-sen-gumi is the crown of ramen on the west coast, so to be able to go up against shin sen gumi is something to be proud off. The tonkatsu ramen soup here taste almost identical to shin sen gumi and I was blown away. Most establishments have really salty or weird flavor soup base like adding butter and garlic for a more western tongue (names I would not mention). The noodle here is the thin style but was a bit more soft compared to shin.  The owner said he could make it more chewy if I wanted to since everything is made by him including the noodles. He also said that his ramen has no added msg or preservative which is surprising to hear. I mean what? Asian food with no msg = mind blown.

Now for the con, the chashu and egg is very average. Here I feel the meat isn't marinated as much and not as sweet. The egg is bland as well like a hard boiled egg, maybe that was the intention to accentuate the flavor of the soup. The place needs more tables also. 

So why did I give 5 stars, based on the soup, noodle, and no msg, this place is on par with shin sen gumi. I support local family business and no longer need to go to la for good ramen. This will be my primary spot from now on.",2017-10-24 20:47:11

The spaghetti was sticky and old tasting. The meatballs were good. The same for the Salad, it came right after I ordered it, and it was a good salad but again, not fresh.

The owner is simply amazing. She remembers everyone! She knows where we sat, what we ate and is a treasure. When we were overwhelmed by the menu or unsure about what to try, she has been ready to make something just for us to meet our tastes. And while she is a one of a kind lady, her staff are all good too, all very friendly and attentive. 
I wish that I could try more of her menu, but I love the Bun so much that I might cry if I went here and didn't get it. Bun is so simple, and until I got it here at Lang Van I was mostly of the opinion that Bun is Bun. Some better than others, but the differences were minor. But at Lang Van it was incredible. Each of the meats was delicious on its own, and the crisp rolls are tasty as well. 
The wife isn't as addicted to Bun as I am, so she tries more on the menu and is never disappointed. I get to try her dishes as well, so best of both worlds for me. We get the fresh summer rolls, as they are always great and my wife would probably divorced me in order to marry that peanut sauce if it were an option.

My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. 

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either.

The collection of tastes, regardless of magnificence, are quickly filed into your culinary memory shortly after you pay and go on your merry way, reserving a moment to determine the probability of your return.
  
Café Monarch is a place where you can go to eat.   A restaurant by definition.   But to simply lump it into that broad classification is criminal.  Mind you, I despise flowery, over-hyped statements seemingly assigned to all things food (and wine) but this place is so much more than a restaurant.  It left me  desperately trying to grasp and hold the sensations of food, wine, atmosphere, music, service, comfort and how they all seemed to work in harmony to make our visit remarkable.   I'm a practical man and mostly grown up.  I try not to get caught up in hype or revel in the splendor of things like froe gras and Manila clam chowder or something called a Winter Salad which were all among best things I've ever put in my mouth.  But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.  

You will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.  

The lofty recommendation to visit Café Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression.",2017-01-27 20:52:48

Tip - Make sure to get on open table and make a reservation if you plan to eat at a specific time. The dinning room section isn't huge and can fill up fast. When we walked in at 8:30 on a Friday night, it was a 1.5 hour wait. 
We ordered the Shrimp and grits, Chicken, Waffles and Watermelon, side of Mac n' Cheese, order of deviled eggs, and order of biscuits. let's just say we over did it....considering this was food for four people.

408,241,1.0,"I hope to bring awareness to our unfortunate experience at Futo Buta to prevent another disabled persons from having to be treated like we were.  We were treated with outright mean spirit and disrespect by our server, Abbey, who did not understand that a disabled guest could not sit on one of the restaurants high tables or on a barstool.

We arrived shortly after opening at 11 am and the hostess graciously sat me and my disabled lunch buddy at one of the tables with chairs and not the tall barstools. The physical limitations of the person I was with inhibit them from being able to sit on a barstool or at a high table.  The server, much to our surprise, started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush. After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly!), the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy.  

It is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved.  We were the first customers of the day.  At this point, there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar. We were not in anyone's way and were not blocking anyone or thing.  We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would.  We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason, but the server did not have one.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch.  

We have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect.  I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities, or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so.  If you do have plan, you should make sure your staff is aware of it.  Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation.

The low rating is for the rude remark the boy at the register gave me when I went back for the chili sauce I asked for.

91,69,4.0,"This place is over the top! The food is great and the portions...when the hell did every restaurant in Vegas begin serving only sumo wrestlers. My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. 

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either. She gave me a look like, do you still want in or not, I have other people to be rude to.",2014-11-30 03:22:06

We also checked in on Facebook and got a free shot which was really nice, but the shot was super intense! It opened up my sinuses and cleared me right up.

130,35,3.0,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.",2015-04-01 13:34:47
579,267,2.0,"Ive eaten at Cheesecake Factory at other locations and had a much better experience, so here we go....We arrive around 12ish on a sunday, which was a horrible time at the South Park mall, dont do it, unless U are jus that bored.  We waited approx 1hr, didnt leave because we knew all the other restaurants would have the same wait time. Once we were seated it went all down hill from there. We didnt get a ""hey how are U"" nor good afternoon, The waitress Whitney K. acted as if we were a bother the whole time. I ordered the veggie appetizer, had to ask for sauce, then I ordered the fish and chips-  asked her if I could substitute the the cole slaw, she said ""no its a Garnish and we cant do that"". She never asked if I wanted to maybe pay extra for a salad or maybe another item. I had to ask for vinegar for my fish, not really understanding at this point why I didnt jus pay and leave. I was so done so no matter what she said or did I wasnt hearing it. Next I asked for the manager, he proceeded to listen and apologize. 

The food really wasnt good after all this mishap, we paid and I left no Tip, which I have never done, this could have been my child. But I feel U should give 100% at work at all times, if not GO home, plenty of people need a job. Im not always happy at work either but I make sure I dont reflect this in my service to the public. Once a manager or owner of a business has mastered this with there employees U will have happy customers who will wait and return. I went to Olive Garden the next day, and the staff were all 100% my waiter earned the 20% I left him. I never asked for anything, he was very professional and they were busy on Memorial Day!!

Now this tops it off, before leaving I saw Miss Whitney show my receipt to the manager, I left no TIP, she made a weird face to him....really do U expect me to leave my hard earned money to someone who was rude to my family???

795,322,1.0,"After reading reviews, we decided to finally try Avenue B as it had been on our list for quite some time. I have to say, I found everything about this place to be lackluster. We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can't think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It's possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I'm already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge. There are much better options in the city, both cheaper and better, and I will not be returning to Avenue B.",2017-03-15 01:57:34

833,323,5.0,"This place has unanimously won the best hookah place in Vegas in my book.
I've visited almost ALL local hookah lounges/restaurants in the valley and I've come to the easy conclusion that Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe is the best there is.

Here is why:

1) HOOKAH: Everything they do leading up to making a good hookah bowl is pretty standard and similar to most places, however, the ice-filled bases are a HUGE plus in terms of smoothness. The employee knowledge on the different types of hookah smoking is impressive and informative. They are excellent with their ability to match/mix flavors to your liking. They are understanding when you're not satisfied and will not hesitate to please your hookah taste buds (at least in many of my experiences). SEVERAL of the bowls I've had there last long (beyond two hours). Of course that can change with the frequency of your smoking. The hookahs and hoses are all a high quality and clean (fancy too).

2) FOOD/DRINKS: The food is excellent. All organic and fresh. You can't find another hookah lounge with food at these prices that taste like this. The drinks are eclectic (non-alcoholic). None of them disappoint. Anything from hot tea to iced juices are awesome.

3) EMPLOYEES: The employees are respectful, knowledgeable, and friendly. I treat the employees with respect and they return with respect as well. They handle any issue you have with food or hookah willingly, respectfully, and swiftly. It can get busy at times and service can take longer at times, but that's how it gets sometimes. They know the menu and are excellent with recommendations. They have uniforms that allow customers to distinct who is an employee and who isn't (some places don't do that).

4) AMBIANCE: Good clean space. It's a lounge so when I see people complain about ""table space"" I would suggest going to a restaurant. I make due with the space at hand. The music ranges from electric, dub-step, hip hop, and reggae. They mix it up often. I LOVE when they play reggae there. The music isn't played at an ear-piercing volume consistently (like other hookah places). 

5) PRICE: Reasonable & fair. The regular price for hookah is the similar to all the hookah places in the Valley but there is a happy hour for hookah from 5-8PM. I go there during that time often. The food is worth the money and so are the drinks.

I have my own hookahs at home (several of them) but when I want to wind down from a hard day work, I choose no other place than Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe. It's an awesome hookah place with culture, good food, good drinks, and friendly employees. I follow then on twitter and facebook for any specials they may have.

Thank you Azuza.",2013-06-24 16:15:16

Jose was very professional.. He let us know what was going on through the entire process and when he left everything was running great.. Doctor Cool definitely has a great employee in Jose and he did an outstanding job..

708,322,4.0,"This restaurant is fantastic, but nothing mind blowing. 

It has a menu comparable to legume in the sense that everything is made with the freshest seasonal ingredients.  However...I prefer legume. 

We started the dinner with 2 appetizers: 
- Spare ribs with BBQ sauce 
- Smoked tuna strawberry salad 

Both were delicious.  The spare ribs were meat falling off the bone tender and the sauce was bbq sauce but more refined.  The smoked tuna on the salad made the appetizer worth it. 

For my main course: 
- arctic char and scallops with couscous 

The arctic char was nothing special but the scallops were AMAZING, unquestionably FRESH. Best part of the meal hands down (too bad there were only 2 pieces).  A friend had the ribeye which was also very tasty. 

I definitely enjoyed my meal at avenue b, but with a meal that comes at a hefty price, I don't know if it's worth another trip =/ If I'm paying that much, the food BETTER be mind blowing.",2011-04-22 04:20:59

The bartender was very welcoming and made me feel less self-conscious that I was drinking and eating by myself among the 20, 30-somethings all around out for their happy hour festivities.  I think the biggest appeal for me was that this place reminds me of a lot of the places I loved when living in Austin.  It's a charming house converted to a restaurant/bar with a really nice outdoor patio area.  Both times, I had Sophie's Salad.  Delicious!

924,177,1.0,"I'm here to comment on the conduct of one of the tour leaders taking a group of what appeared to be mainly senior citizens on a tour through Red Rock Canyon Park today.  Their convoy pulled up into the farthest parking lot at the second parking area after you enter the park. The problem was they pulled up on to the side of the walkway right behind parked cars.  That is where my experience begins.  I was with my family and we were in the process of backing out with old people in scooters right behind our car.  It was not safe to do so but tour leader #1 encouraged me to do so.  After successfully backing out I proceeded up the narrow lane created by the convoy parked unsafely on the right of us and the series of parked cars on the left. The left hand turn I have to make is particularly narrow due to the tour leaders scooter parked in the front of the convoy.  Tour leader #2 is in front of my car and recognizes the situation he has created for me.  Rather than get in his scooter and move out of the way he proceeds to gesture his hands and arms wildly assuming the role of traffic cop.  I was distracted by what amounted to me to be an unrequested buffoon show.  As my first pass was unsuccessful rather than allowing me the opportunity to correct my angle myself this buffoon proceeds to come to my drivers side window AND PUT HIS HANDS ON MY STEERING WHEEL....again I did not request his help in any way shape or form.  Now he is asking me to move my vehicle as he commandeers the steering wheel to correct my angle.  My family is looking on with startled discomfort as though to think whats this buffoon going to do next?  He created a highly unsafe situation as a result of his buffoonery...

As I was leaving this buffoon decides to save his own face and announce to the convoy of disbelieving tourists that ""He Cant Drive"".... are you kidding me?  You come into my family and my life unwelcomed in the most buffoonish way, create a buffoonish situation and now try to launch a buffoonish insult to your paying customers?

I have not taken this tour would not recommend it based on my peripheral experience and would certainly caution anyone to place there lives in the hands of a clear buffoon tourist leader.  Ruined what was otherwise a lovely family day out.",2017-11-18 21:07:11

It's a comfortable restaurant that's only been open for about two months. The meatballs were delicious and the menus were very original. I had the pork meatballs in a panini with Gouda and spinach almond pesto. The sauce was amazing. For a side I had the rocket salad with balsamic vinaigrette.

53,50,4.0,"First I want to say that our group had an AMAZING time at Encore Beach!!!!!  BUT, we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.

For some people this is a good thing, but for those looking forward to being able to gamble and whatnot till 4AM in the morning and then take an elevator to your room to rest, try elsewhere.  Besides that though, this place is great.

My only gripe with this hotel was one involving me reserving 2 Queen/Solitaire Suite with (2) Queen Beds, but when I got there they only had the (2) suites with (1) King Bed each.  I spoke with them and called in for the pull in beds and it also helped that the couch was also a pull out too, so that served our needs.  So, all in all, wasn't a deal breaker.  

I did like the suites though for the most part, bathroom was huge, Kitchen came stocked with glasses, silverware, and small appliances, no pots or pans, but it didn't matter.  Although we didn't use it that much, it was nice to have it available to us if we did.

The place itself is located (2) blocks from the strip and is pretty easy to find from the 15 Freeway.  Get off on flamingo and keep driving down, and it will be on your right.

8,8,4.0,"notes: 1 visit, breakfast/lunch
overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.

highlights: 
- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.
- Prime rib is excellent
- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.
- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

Avoid:
- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.
- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.",2010-01-08 04:28:23

15,14,2.0,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2017-01-02 03:48:03

I wasn't too hungry, but I could eat. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos--which were seasoned to perfection. So of course I was obliged to return. I came back the next day to get a burrito. Returned the next for a chimichanga. 

I think the bottom line here is I may require rehab. I'm addicted.",2015-10-17 01:02:29

Cons:

I'm a little unsettled venturing out to restaurants/bars by myself, but sitting at the bar and ordering during my solo visit was a great experience.  The bartender was very welcoming and made me feel less self-conscious that I was drinking and eating by myself among the 20, 30-somethings all around out for their happy hour festivities.  I think the biggest appeal for me was that this place reminds me of a lot of the places I loved when living in Austin.  It's a charming house converted to a restaurant/bar with a really nice outdoor patio area.  Both times, I had Sophie's Salad.  Delicious!  I also tried the Salty Hog, which is a great choice if you're looking for a refreshing mixed drink (and you're a bacon lover).

82,74,2.0,"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.",2015-01-03 21:34:24
592,299,5.0,"Wow can I be more impressed? First of all, if you are a ramen enthusiast, then you have heard about shin sen gumi ramen from LA j-town. Shin-sen-gumi is the crown of ramen on the west coast, so to be able to go up against shin sen gumi is something to be proud off. The tonkatsu ramen soup here taste almost identical to shin sen gumi and I was blown away. Most establishments have really salty or weird flavor soup base like adding butter and garlic for a more western tongue (names I would not mention). The noodle here is the thin style but was a bit more soft compared to shin.  The owner said he could make it more chewy if I wanted to since everything is made by him including the noodles. He also said that his ramen has no added msg or preservative which is surprising to hear. I mean what? Asian food with no msg = mind blown.

Now for the con, the chashu and egg is very average. Here I feel the meat isn't marinated as much and not as sweet. The egg is bland as well like a hard boiled egg, maybe that was the intention to accentuate the flavor of the soup. The place needs more tables also. 

So why did I give 5 stars, based on the soup, noodle, and no msg, this place is on par with shin sen gumi. I support local family business and no longer need to go to la for good ramen. This will be my primary spot from now on.",2017-10-24 20:47:11

We ordered our Carrot Cake martinis, and we wanted to each pay our own bill, so he gave us a number of 22 each, but the drink itself was suppose to be 18 dollars.  Some paid with credit card and some paid with cash. 

I gave him 25 cash, and I was waiting for my change.  At the same time, I looked at my friend's bill who used her credit card, there was an ""automatic"" gratuity charge of $3.00 dollars added to the bill!!!  I don't know there was this charge when we had a party of 3. 
Okay, maybe there is, so as I was waiting for my $3 dollar change, I did not get anything for 3 minutes, so I asked the bartender, and he was like, I am getting it..... And he came back right away, and tossed it on the table like he was pissed... 
I was unhappy with this service, because that was just wrong to try and keep the change when I did not voluntarily give it to him. In addition the added $3 gratuity!!!

130,35,3.0,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.",2015-04-01 13:34:47

We were incredibly happy with our purchase. As first time homebuyers and moving from out of state we were literally and mentally in new territory. His team walked us through every step of the process and we were able to get something great for our growing family within our budget in such a competitive market.

What really stood out was how the sale of our home went. We had already made a few minor upgrades to the property, but when it came time to sell, Bill gave us a few pointers to polish up the place. Using all of his recommended vendors, we were able to accomplish this in a short time and for low cost. He appropriately read the market and priced our home reasonably, and we ended up selling our home within a few days and walked away with an extra $30,000 cash in our pockets.

The cashier lady was very nice and kind, but seemed to have a bit of trouble at the register.  I think maybe something was broken so it took a while for us just to get to order.

I ordered the Napoleon crepe, lemon custard, berries, chantilly cream, nom nom nom! It was REALLY good, the tartness of the custard and lightly sweet thick chantilly cream worked well together.

Unfortunately they don't fill all the way to the edge so the front tip of the triangle is filled while the back end is just crepe.  Is that how it's done in Paris?  I also feel like they were a bit too thick and eggy to be considered ""good"" crepes, but it was tasty nonetheless. I think the filling just sold me...

$9.99 does seem expensive to me for a crepe since they are kind of cheap to make...but it is Vegas so got to expect everything to be expensive :P

They have a great happy hour with a nice selection of beers on tap and a few bucks off cocktails. The food has always been the big draw for me. LOVE the Sheridan sandwich! Toasted and cheesy :) The Red Goat salad is delicious with pistachios, goat cheese, strawberries, and their to-die-for balsamic vinaigrette! Mac n Cheese is a hit as well! 

The service has always been poor, but that has become expected. It takes a long time to be greeted, and expect your glass to be empty for awhile before they come around to offer you another. The waitress always seems to be rude and acts like you are bothering her. Other than that, I recommend it! It's in a cute Phoenix historic house and they place cool music :)",2012-08-15 17:29:23

924,177,1.0,"I'm here to comment on the conduct of one of the tour leaders taking a group of what appeared to be mainly senior citizens on a tour through Red Rock Canyon Park today.  Their convoy pulled up into the farthest parking lot at the second parking area after you enter the park. The problem was they pulled up on to the side of the walkway right behind parked cars.  That is where my experience begins.  I was with my family and we were in the process of backing out with old people in scooters right behind our car.  It was not safe to do so but tour leader #1 encouraged me to do so.  After successfully backing out I proceeded up the narrow lane created by the convoy parked unsafely on the right of us and the series of parked cars on the left. The left hand turn I have to make is particularly narrow due to the tour leaders scooter parked in the front of the convoy.  Tour leader #2 is in front of my car and recognizes the situation he has created for me.  Rather than get in his scooter and move out of the way he proceeds to gesture his hands and arms wildly assuming the role of traffic cop.  I was distracted by what amounted to me to be an unrequested buffoon show.  As my first pass was unsuccessful rather than allowing me the opportunity to correct my angle myself this buffoon proceeds to come to my drivers side window AND PUT HIS HANDS ON MY STEERING WHEEL....again I did not request his help in any way shape or form.  Now he is asking me to move my vehicle as he commandeers the steering wheel to correct my angle.  My family is looking on with startled discomfort as though to think whats this buffoon going to do next?  He created a highly unsafe situation as a result of his buffoonery...

As I was leaving this buffoon decides to save his own face and announce to the convoy of disbelieving tourists that ""He Cant Drive"".... are you kidding me?  You come into my family and my life unwelcomed in the most buffoonish way, create a buffoonish situation and now try to launch a buffoonish insult to your paying customers?

I have not taken this tour would not recommend it based on my peripheral experience and would certainly caution anyone to place there lives in the hands of a clear buffoon tourist leader.  Ruined what was otherwise a lovely family day out.",2017-11-18 21:07:11

No one kept bumping into us or anything and the other guests were pretty nice! No one thought they were better than anyone at this club, unlike Hakkasan. This resulted in a very nice vibe. The drinks here were pricey, about $40 for two drinks, however, it was good and i was celebrating my birthday so eh, why not? The guest performance was logic and keep this in mind, all of the artists usually performs at 2AM! this is like every club! Hakkasan was the same with Zedd.

Everything was fantastic, and I will explain... my buddy and I went for a late lunch today (Monday) and there was only a few people there, so for me it was perfect since I am not a fan of crowds.  Next, the decorations are creative, fun and playful... and I had never thought to use holiday light sculptures as a decoration other than a yard ornament, but it is looks great and works for the space.  The server was excellent and attentive; he came back to the table at least 4 or 5 times, and repeatedly refilled our drinks, made sure we were doing okay, asked if we needed anything... wonderful service.  I ate the El Diablo, which was great... really spicy, but I like to sweat and tear up when eating tasty things.  It brought a tear to my eye; but in a good way.  The burger was spicier than I expected which caught me off guard... loved every minute of it.  The quality of food was excellent and matched with the quantity, which was very filling.  The menu had so many things I wanted to try.  The beer list looked great, but need a designated driver for next time.

971,236,2.0,"*this review is based on service experience,  not food. 

Dear Morris Ramen,

I came to you on the afternoon of 9/8/17 with a slip of paper that held my full name, card number, and expiration date. Knowing you do not take reservations, after speaking with the host, I explained and wrote down the 3 customers who would be coming in at 7pm and that I would like to pay for their first round of drinks. (Written on paper with bank and customer info given to host.)

I arrive at 7pm with said guests. Table is sat, I order a round of sake. I am short on time and have to leave my guests before they are done eating. While still at the table, a server quickly drops off the slip of paper which I gave to the host earlier in the day with my card info on it. I ask the busied server ""is this taken care of?"" She says ""yes"".  
Later I receive a text from my friend that she had to pay for the sake I promised to have earlier taken care of. My friend says to me ""they said they don't do that"". 

It has been 30 minutes past with me calling your business number to discuss this matter and to offer my guests dessert as well as a fixed payment, and unfortunately, no answer. 

I am very dissatisfied with this. I stated clearly to the host with my name and phone number as well card info to apply to the check and to give me a call if there was any problems. I was later identified as this person and no action was taken. It was not only embarrassing but unprofessional.",2017-09-09 01:26:19

THIS is the chino I know and love, and have frequented since forever. I have in front of me a tin of deliciousness filled to the brim, an extra snickerdoodle, and I'm sporting a gigantic grin that can only be caused by this sort of food euphoria. 

What's more important, the old chino is back on the inside too! And that's what counts right? I was greeted by a friendly girl who offered to help with ordering, and several people were smiling and looked like they were enjoying the bustling Sunday night atmosphere. Speaking of bustling, it was! And it felt great, all sorts of energy in the room and all positive vibes. 

I doubt my previous reviews had anything to do with it, maybe I just got unlucky a few times...but whatever it is, chino is back to its rightful place at the forefront of my mind and heart, and it retakes it's reign as the absolute best and most unique dining experience in Phoenix.

Crab curry--takes like ocean-flavored red curry. And with little nests of vermicelli noodles, it's a must-try.

I've only been in about 3 times to this store but there is a reason for that.  All 3 times I've ever been to the store it seems no one wants to help me. Everytime I've been in, I stand there for 5+ minutes with no one to help me. Not even a friendly ""hello"". 

My most recent visit was to just simply pick up a new phone case for my son.  Walked in, waited, and waited. Numerous employees would walk by, have direct eye contact with me, and continue to ignore me. People who walked in after I had arrived and waited were getting helped right away before me. 

I really don't like making an issue because I've worked years in retail and I know how it can be. But customer service is a big deal to me and if it's a terrible experience, I will give my opinion.  Otherwise how do you learn it's a bad experience. But I decided to let a store employee know that I had waited, was never greeted, and had other shoppers helped before me. This is the last time I'll ever go into this store. I will only go to other ones I've had better experiences at or shop online.

We waited approx 1hr, didnt leave because we knew all the other restaurants would have the same wait time. Once we were seated it went all down hill from there. We didnt get a ""hey how are U"" nor good afternoon, The waitress Whitney K. acted as if we were a bother the whole time. I ordered the veggie appetizer, had to ask for sauce, then I ordered the fish and chips-  asked her if I could substitute the the cole slaw, she said ""no its a Garnish and we cant do that"". She never asked if I wanted to maybe pay extra for a salad or maybe another item. I had to ask for vinegar for my fish, not really understanding at this point why I didnt jus pay and leave. I was so done so no matter what she said or did I wasnt hearing it. Next I asked for the manager, he proceeded to listen and apologize. 

The food really wasnt good after all this mishap, we paid and I left no Tip, which I have never done, this could have been my child. But I feel U should give 100% at work at all times, if not GO home, plenty of people need a job. Im not always happy at work either but I make sure I dont reflect this in my service to the public. Once a manager or owner of a business has mastered this with there employees U will have happy customers who will wait and return. I went to Olive Garden the next day, and the staff were all 100% my waiter earned the 20% I left him. I never asked for anything, he was very professional and they were busy on Memorial Day!!

Now this tops it off, before leaving I saw Miss Whitney show my receipt to the manager, I left no TIP, she made a weird face to him....really do U expect me to leave my hard earned money to someone who was rude to my family???

The Slut $10.50 on the other hand tasted like mash potatoes .  I did not care for this at all.

Only one of the sites was really suited for exploring. I would have liked going to another site where we could walk around on rocks more, or just more time in general to hike. The day we went it was raining a little, so they didn't give us very much time at some of the stops, and I felt kind of rushed because of this. I understand they basically never get rain, but it was only a little drizzle, and we were on an adventurous tour. Otherwise, the tour guides are great.

799,35,5.0,"It was my first time in Vegas and let me just say, the Venetian was such a beautiful hotel to stay at. 

Firstly, the lobby is beautiful with the high ceilings with beautiful Grecian styled paintings. The front desk attendants were all very kind and patient. They even gave us an upgrade. We got a room with a view of the pools! After walking through the casino to get to the room towers (which wasn't too far nor was it difficult to navigate), we headed up to our magnificent room.
It was spacious, clean, and so gorgeous. I really like the theme of the Venetian, makes you feel like royalty! The bathroom is the first door when you walk in and it was huge. Separate shower and bath. Great vanity space which also had a light up desk mirror in addition to the double sink. 

The room itself was also very spacious. Giant king bed that was so comfortable. With extra living space with sofa with a pull out bed. The two T.Vs were on the smaller side but we didn't spend much time in our rooms lounging so they weren't a huge issue. The mini bar was expensive but there were multiple Walgreen's close by so we didn't purchase anything from it!

The service was impeccable. We didn't have the room cleaned everyday but when we needed it to be cleaned, we would call down and leave the room for an hour or two for a meal and it would be quickly cleaned by the time we were back. 

The pools are also really big and lots of chairs available. There's little to no kids and there's even an adults only pool! 

The food options are pretty decent. There's a couple of late night spots opened as well. Most of the time we wandered off the strip to try new things but there is definitely a variety available in the Venetian. 

I have no complaints about this hotel. Great service and amazing rooms.",2017-07-28 19:05:39

1156,61,1.0,"I'm sorry to have to do this, but the owner of this place is a jerk.  I got yelled at, for playing pinball in a way that has helped me play very well in pinball tournaments and leagues over the years, and not one time has anyone, including the owners of some very rare and valuable games, mentioned anything to me about abusing a machine.  But that wasn't the case here at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  Instead, I was told (in a very confrontational way) that new Stern machines were all made of plastic, the flipper buttons (of course), the sides (huh?) and the legs (did he really just say that?!?) and that I better calm down or I would be asked to leave.  BULL$HIT.  He treated me like a moron--flat out lied to me thinking I must not know any better.  This was after he stood about 5 feet away from me with his arms crossed watching very disapprovingly as I would hit the side of an Avatar machine to keep the ball from exiting the right orbit and dropping into the right sling.  Watch just about any pinball video or tutorial and it's pretty clear this is the sorta thing you have to do to control the ball and continue playing.  It also does absolutely nothing to harm the game, and hitting the side with a sledgehammer certainly wouldn't have caused a pop bumper to be non-functional, or the one-way gate at the top of the left orbit to be jammed up, as they were on this particular machine.  It also wouldn't have caused AC/DC to be about 5 degrees off level.  And to make matters worse, I never encountered a tilt warning on AC/DC, Avatar, or the one EM I played before I was warned for a second time for making a very light slap save.

I would think that Mr. Tim Arnold, of such long standing participation in the world of pinball operation, maintenance and collecting would know how to set a tilt bob to prevent players from being able to move the game in the slightest, since that's apparently what he wants. I can now only assume that's much too difficult a task, and it doesn't give him an opportunity to eject people that obviously know what the hell they're doing on a pinball machine, and that might otherwise complain about the poor operational condition of most of the games in his establishment.  I chose to leave on my own after the second warning during which time I was followed out the door while continuing to be berated.  I have no desire to ever go back and give this guy another quarter, so he can flip it all to the Salvation Army (400k last year) while continuing to let his games sit broken and refusing help from volunteers to get them repaired in a reasonable time frame.  You'd think he could take some of that money and invest it back into the place but I guess that's now how he wants to do business.  It keeps the ""complainers"" away.",2012-09-10 20:55:22

I've been stuck on their Cobb salad which boasts more food than I really should eat but in the true spirit of American overindulgence, I clean my bowl every time.  Service is really good and I can be in and out quickly if need be.

134,112,4.0,"Went with a party of six the other night and wasn't sure what to expect based on the mixed reviews.  They do not serve individual meals but rather small to medium plates meant for sharing.  I was very nervous about how this would work as we have very adventurous eaters in our group down to a pregnant picky eater.  Our water recommended 2 selections per person.  This ended up being a bit to much food.  The ratio of 1.5 per person would be better.  The food comes out as its ready,not all at once.  Be prepared in advance to share food. We ordered: oysters on the half shell with the siracha lime dressing ( some of our parties first experience-success), a meat and cheese board (jellies were weird-wouldn't order again), chicken wings, roasted chicken, lobster roll, sliders, macaroni and cheese, green beans, steak tartare ( skip), a breakfast dish, mussels and calamari. For the most part our entire table enjoyed all of the food and was very happy.  The rings were perhaps the biggest hit ( they are a little spicy and smokey)  resulting in one member of our party declaring we must perfect our smoking technique in order to do wings like that at home.  The green beans were also a big hit, which is shocking because we were not that excited about ordering beans. Overall we had a great time but it was in part because we were willing to share, work together on a menu selection and have fun. Go with an open mind, good group and you will not be disappointed.  There was some confusion with the beer flights ordered but our waiter (who was excellent) quickly corrected.",2015-08-30 13:58:44

I met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine. 

There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink. 

I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling.

875,167,5.0,"First off: I LOVE THIS PLACE!  This place is like family to me and I'll go here for as long as they are in business. Perfect for Indian imported groceries or if you're hungry and you don't feel like cooking, you can dine in or take out delicious meals. 

My favorites: 
Butter Chicken- The chicken is tender, juicy, and it soaks up the color from all the spices and flavors it gets marinated in. The sauce is perfect!

Chicken or Lamb Vindaloo- I've had both. I prefer extra spicy foods. If you like it hot and spicy, I suggest you request them to make it extra spicy for you. It is a hot lava heaven of flavors. The potatoes resemble embers because of spices and the dark red color of the sauce. It's awesome!

Aloo gobi- if you're wanting more of a spiced veggie dish, the cauliflower/potato combo is flavorful, it has a slight little kick of heat.

Gobi 65- The cauliflower dumplings entree. WOW! It's a mild vegetarian dish, but it is warm and comforting. The cauliflower dumplings are in a subtly spiced yogurt gravy, and the best way I can describe it is like India's version of an alfredo sauce with cauliflower. I highly recommend it, it's so good!

Samosas-  Great vegetable samosas! The filling is balanced with the holy trinity of Indian spices like curry, cumin, and coriander. There are even bits of cilantro in it as well. You can never go wrong to order these as a snack or to add to your meal.

Best garlic Naan too, perfect texture and fresh! 

Last but not least, THE BEST EVER!!!
Fresh Pickled Lemon/ Lemon Chutney- This deserves a mention. I've been told these lemons are fresh from the family lemon tree, it's a family recipe. Grandpa Singh won't teach me how to make my own, so I have to come here and ask them for large containers of it or bring a jar because they are the BEST and no other Indian restaurant has this, so it's a rare treasure. LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! Best lemon chutney you will ever find in Arizona! 

In conclusion, I love this place! I love the people! I've tried a few other Indian restaurants and most of them don't even compare. There are plenty of other items to choose from on the menu. This place never disappoints me and it deserves a higher rating!",2017-03-15 03:21:12

But as a former Flagstaffian, the Bookmans in Phoenix is nowhere near as plentiful and varied in content matter as is the Flagstaff Location...nor does it have a cafe, which is a must for a bookstore I feel. Furthermore, the trade credit dollars given have shrunk in comparison to the rise in the price of books on the shelves anymore. I understand that this is a business needing to make money to sustain, but sometimes it feels like I am being ripped off on both ends of the spectrum. Furthermore, there are several items I have purchased and then been told, not even one month later (and upon losing the receipts so just trying to take the item back for a lesser amount in trade credit) that they are not interested in rebuying from me. I wish there was some way the Bookman stores would intertrade stock, so that the same books are not always on the shelves. I rarely find a science book that is unique to the stock on hand anymore, and only go in maybe once a month if that. I wish there were more used bookstores in the area of Bookmans, because if anything it would force them to stay more honest and competitive..versus the monopoly it holds on the surrounding area which results many times in a more lackluster brand of service and selection because it can.",2013-01-27 21:03:49

974,360,1.0,"I recently visited The Deuce Lounge at Aria and I did not have a pleasant experience with the bartender.  I stayed at Aria for the weekend and all the employees are nice and helpful; however, when I went into the Deuce Lounge, the bartender who helped was rude in his respect. 
We ordered our Carrot Cake martinis, and we wanted to each pay our own bill, so he gave us a number of 22 each, but the drink itself was suppose to be 18 dollars.  Some paid with credit card and some paid with cash. 

I gave him 25 cash, and I was waiting for my change.  At the same time, I looked at my friend's bill who used her credit card, there was an ""automatic"" gratuity charge of $3.00 dollars added to the bill!!!  I don't know there was this charge when we had a party of 3. 
Okay, maybe there is, so as I was waiting for my $3 dollar change, I did not get anything for 3 minutes, so I asked the bartender, and he was like, I am getting it..... And he came back right away, and tossed it on the table like he was pissed... 
I was unhappy with this service, because that was just wrong to try and keep the change when I did not voluntarily give it to him. In addition the added $3 gratuity!!! 

This was a very unpleasant visit in the Deuce Lounge and I expected a more laid back professional experience inside the Aria.",2011-06-29 04:07:22

992,90,5.0,"This place is a GREAT alternative to Tacos El Gordo. In fact, I think this place is much better than Tacos El Gordo. First, the actual venue is very nice. It is very clean, open and hip. I love how they have a line to separate the different meats you want in your tacos/burritos/quesadillas.  Closer to the cash register, is a bar and another line to order fries, nachos, corn, etc... 

The food is delicious but I've only had Carne Asada tacos and Carne Asada fries. I have yet to try the corn and other meats. I'm sure they all taste great as they look delicious on everyone else's plates. 

The venue also has a condiments area in the middle which is very very hearty with salsas, veggies and a few other fresh accompaniments to your food. 

Lastly, the staff is very nice. I especially love the lady that serves in the line where you order your sides and extras (fries, corn, nachos, etc...). She is amazing!",2017-09-09 15:42:32

All the typical ingredients including 2 avocados.  Almost a meal by itself.  My wife and I split three tacos (fish, pulled pork and I cant remember).  All were excellent.  Margaritas, the defining item at a Mexican restaurant were really good!!  We had both with and without the house made mixture.  Not too sweet or sour or acidic.  Very nice!!!

Phillip was a great waiter and offered great suggestions and information regarding the menu.

If you let your waiter know that you are celebrating a special occasion, they will give you a free drink or dessert. We celebrated my friend's birthday there and got a free plate of mochi and fruity ice cream.

The only reason I don't give this place five stars is that you really do not get much food at all for the price. The sushi rolls are tasty, but quite small.",2013-09-04 01:50:05

576,294,2.0,"Hello Matthew,
 You are correct, when you came by our table we did tell you things were fine. If you would have checked with your staff you would have been informed that I did complain to the server that the bacon tempura was not good prior to you coming to our table. I would have thought that he would have informed you as the place wasn't to busy. We did hear him tell the kitchen staff about it. Plus if you had looked at our plates when you came to the table, I would have thought the pile of batter on the plate would have been a clue? If you didn't see it then you surly saw it when it was cleared from the table. I didn't fell it necessary to complain twice, your staff should have informed you, that is just my opinion on that. The other thing was the server did ask about a replacement, I declined. I also paid the bill in full without any compensation for an un happy customer. 
As for you being a small busy, I am trying to do my part for you. Our first meal there was great! This is an opportunity for you to hear from your customers and maybe take a look at things that need to be tweaked or changed. 
I wish you well.
This is what Yelp is for to inform and hopefully help.",2018-03-23 18:50:48

1150,332,5.0,"5 stars.  This is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh, in my humble opinion.  *Disclaimer*  I studied Spanish in college, have been to Spain twice, and likely have a nostalgia for that culture and food that really hits me in the feels.  Regardless, I was recently at a tapas bar/restaurant in DC that didn't even come close to Morcilla.

Where to start?  The beauty of a tapas style restaurant is that the portions are small and offer a perfect couple of bites between two people, so you can really start anywhere and circle around the menu to your heart's content.  Although if you had to ask me, I'd say you should start at the oxtail and blood sausage.  After you've kick started your senses, meander around to the restaurant's take on Spanish tortilla and choose some sort of oily fish to cleanse your palate.  Finally, bask in all the glory of España and savor some jamon Iberico along with a sherry (or several).

I'll be at the bar, and you can buy me a drink for detailing the best way to eat, at the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.",2016-11-22 02:17:25

141,94,2.0,"When it comes to the usual Costco deals and weekly road shows, this Costco is fine, but there are two big problems with this store:

1. In the last few months, the sample severs have gotten increasingly cranky and sometimes outright hostile. They have always been rude to my kids, who are generally polite, but today takes the cake. The server CHEWED out my son for touching one sample, then the other. Normally, that would be bad beahvior, but these were fully wrapped chocolates, not some greasy fish stick. The guy -- who was working the CHRISTMAS SECTION --  was so mad, I had to tell my son not to worry about it as we quickly walked away.

About half of the servers at this store are polite enough, but NONE of them EVER SMILE.

2. Even worse than the servers are the patrons, who are horrid creatures reminiscent of goblins from the Hobbit. Here are some examples:

*One time, two elderly women started swearing at each other as they fought for the parking spot I was trying to vacate. One woman, whose husband was driving in circles on the opposite side of the parking lot, literally stood in the spot I left while the other tried to run her over. I wish I was exaggerating, but I had to roll up my windows so the kids couldn't here the exchange of swear words. 

*My kids have been shoved out of the way of samples as if they have no right to be there.

*My kids have been rammed with carts by impatient shoppers who don't seem to understand that youngsters can get disorientated by the frenetic nature of that particular store. Heck, the traffic jams near the ready-to-eat chicken area can run 10-15 carts deep.

*I've had customers literally push us out of the way to lay claim to some product or another.

The staff is okay at this store, which I've frequented since 2008, but they don't work as hard at being friendly or helpful compared with other stores I've visited. I don't know what, if anything, they can do about the bad customers, but it seems they should at least be aware that the Scottsdale store is out of control.",2014-10-11 05:12:18

Bad experience however in the gun department. I waited there for 45 minutes with my number, but they only have two employees and they were both helping people buy a gun fill out the paperwork and then buy accessories. Really pretty annoying that you can get that jammed up because of only 2 people in the store in front of you. They should have a separate person who actually calls in the transfers. I was going to buy a gun but after waiting for 45min in an empty store, I googled what I wanted to buy and found it cheaper other places and online, so I left, never being helped or even looked at. Also overhearing their conversations they offered some bad firearm advice which was kind of scary.

The check-in can be confusing because it's all done at a kiosk and during an emergency the last thought on your mind is to walk into an ER only to have your first contact be with a kiosk instead of a human.

The hostess suggested blankets. So she pulled out cozy blankets to cover our chilly laps! After sitting at our intimate table underneath the heaters, I really didn't need it and enjoyed the moonlit sky.

Our server was Andre and he was great! Attentive and friendly without being too chatty. My husband had the sea bass and I had the pork tenderloin. We also had the wedge salad. Sticky buns yummy as always! Our food was moist, delicious and perfectly cooked. Soooo happy! Only complaint was that our wedge salad (which Andre had divided into two for us) had too much dressing on it.
Second complaint was that the food was so good, I overate. My pooch is sticking out as I write.

In our conversation, Andre mentioned that there was a new chef in the kitchen when we said how great our food was. Strongly recommend El Chorro.",2013-12-08 03:09:51

I called the company and was told he had not checked-in yet on this call. Really? Check the donut shop. Asked the dumbest questions like ""why is it cool on this side of the house?""

33,31,3.0,"The service was pretty bad. There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any. 

Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas. 

The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. 

One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. 

Definitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.",2013-10-03 08:38:38

Yardbird's specialty is their fried chicken. The kind waitress explained how the chicken is brined for 25 hours and flash fried in 3 minutes - quite impressive numbers! I guess bottom line: you get what you paid for. Chicken was delicious and moist on the inside, but for $26 for 4 pieces of chicken, I highly doubt I'll return for seconds. That's $7 for each piece!

808,166,2.0,"Wanted to stop somewhere for a quick bite before a show last night.  First choice had a huge line waiting to get in (place just opened), so I continued down the strip and ended up at 800 Degrees.

Really cool concept, you walk in, and there's a guy working the pizza dough (all pies are same size, 12"").  When he's finished, your dough moves to the next station: sauce, cheese, the basics.  Then if you'd like to add any more ingredients you can for $1.50 each.  I chose the basic Margherita pizza, reasonably priced @ under $8.  Move down the line, pay for your order, and your pie goes into the 800+ degree oven.  It's cooked in a couple minutes, and your ready to eat.

At first I was kinda disappointed when I picked up the first slice and all the toppings slid off.  However, upon further investigation (there's a brochure right by the entrance), I learned that you're supposed to eat this type of pie with a knife & fork, I guess that's ""Neopolitan"" style.   Once I armed myself with the proper utensils, it was a much better experience.  The pizza was a little soggier than I would like, but it did have a nice flavor, the crust was great.  It did get cold a bit quicker than expected, however.  My last couple slices were at room temperature by the time I finished.

Overall, I'd say this place is a decent value, especially for a strip eatery.  Definitely better than a Sbarro, or other franchise place. However, as a LV local, I'll probably stick to my neighborhood joints in the future.",2015-01-18 17:53:09

I have a bit of a gripe about the omelets...my fiance and I made it a point to get here before breakfast service ended precisely because I wanted to hit the omelet bar. We got in with about 30 minutes of breakfast service left, and when I got to the omelet station they were already breaking it down and getting ready for lunch. There was only the standard ""huge platter filled with scrambled eggs sitting over a sterno can."" I was annoyed...I complained ""I didn't pay all that money to eat pre-made eggs sitting under a heat lamp!"" Now, I'll give the guy credit...he said ""I'll make you whatever you want"" and so I still got my omelet! That was the right thing to do and I appreciated it. But it seems like I shouldn't have had to complain...most people wouldn't have said anything and would have just walked away disappointed. They should find a way to keep the station open right up until the end of the breakfast service.

Besides that, nothing but good things to say. I had a fantastic mimosa and made myself some sliders on rolls with the meats from the carving station, which were amazingly tender. The crab legs were the sweetest I've ever had...I think the snow crab was a little better than the king crab.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafood-buffet-glendale#hrid:JnIwxV7PDcIRU7PhAETMrA) 

I bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is. 

The line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.

When you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees? 

I barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies. 

I will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again.",2012-06-26 19:10:08
1156,61,1.0,"I'm sorry to have to do this, but the owner of this place is a jerk.  I got yelled at, for playing pinball in a way that has helped me play very well in pinball tournaments and leagues over the years, and not one time has anyone, including the owners of some very rare and valuable games, mentioned anything to me about abusing a machine.  But that wasn't the case here at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  Instead, I was told (in a very confrontational way) that new Stern machines were all made of plastic, the flipper buttons (of course), the sides (huh?) and the legs (did he really just say that?!?) and that I better calm down or I would be asked to leave.  BULL$HIT.  He treated me like a moron--flat out lied to me thinking I must not know any better.  This was after he stood about 5 feet away from me with his arms crossed watching very disapprovingly as I would hit the side of an Avatar machine to keep the ball from exiting the right orbit and dropping into the right sling.  Watch just about any pinball video or tutorial and it's pretty clear this is the sorta thing you have to do to control the ball and continue playing.  It also does absolutely nothing to harm the game, and hitting the side with a sledgehammer certainly wouldn't have caused a pop bumper to be non-functional, or the one-way gate at the top of the left orbit to be jammed up, as they were on this particular machine.  It also wouldn't have caused AC/DC to be about 5 degrees off level.  And to make matters worse, I never encountered a tilt warning on AC/DC, Avatar, or the one EM I played before I was warned for a second time for making a very light slap save.

I would think that Mr. Tim Arnold, of such long standing participation in the world of pinball operation, maintenance and collecting would know how to set a tilt bob to prevent players from being able to move the game in the slightest, since that's apparently what he wants. I can now only assume that's much too difficult a task, and it doesn't give him an opportunity to eject people that obviously know what the hell they're doing on a pinball machine, and that might otherwise complain about the poor operational condition of most of the games in his establishment.  I chose to leave on my own after the second warning during which time I was followed out the door while continuing to be berated.  I have no desire to ever go back and give this guy another quarter, so he can flip it all to the Salvation Army (400k last year) while continuing to let his games sit broken and refusing help from volunteers to get them repaired in a reasonable time frame.  You'd think he could take some of that money and invest it back into the place but I guess that's now how he wants to do business.  It keeps the ""complainers"" away.",2012-09-10 20:55:22

565,82,3.0,"Very good food! Very horrible service!   I am giving this place 3 stars only because the food is a solid 5 stars. Indeed, this is the only good Mexican restaurant I can find in the Charlotte area that can be anything close to authentic.  Although, the style is much more Tex-Mex and not what I am use to from living on the West Coast most of my life.

I am giving the service, however, one star!   

The place is very crowded and obviously, understaffed.  I've had a few problems coming to this restaurant.  The first time I came it took them over 45 minutes to get me my meal and I almost had to walk out, but the meal finally came and I was just visiting Charlotte and starving that night, so I waited.

However, my third time coming I ordered a beef chimichanga.   Well, when I received the order I started eating it and finally noticed they did not give me beef, but chicken.  I mentioned it to them and they were not sorry at all and did not offer to reimburse me.  Instead, they said, ""OH YEAH, THAT HAPPENS A LOT HERE"".  I am like WTH???  They made me pay for the full price of the meal and did not offer any compensation or any apologies at all..   I guess TOUGH LUCK if they screw up your order, right?   They could have marked a little off my bill, since I did not ask them to bring it back and re-cook it.

As well, the servers are always unfriendly and act like you are bothering them. I always go to the bar because the place is so packed and really does not have enough space for the amount of people who go there.  I don't even bother coming to this place on the weekend.  The owners need to find a larger building or hire more staff.   

Seriously, this place has horrible service and even makes me question if I want to come back.  Charlotte is hurting for good, authentic Mexican and that is why this place is so popular, because it is quite good.  However, expect to be treated like you are a burden. Basically, the only thing they want is your money.. They want to seat you, slap food on the table, take your money and get rid of you as quick as possible.  It is not a very uplifting experience to eat here, even though the food is good.",2018-08-14 04:26:44

I leaned over a couple times to see if I could catch his attention. Nope. So I walked down to where his friends were sitting and stood there (not in an a-hole way...just in a hey there, I'm here way)  He continued to talk to his friends. I finally turned to walk away and I heard him say oh I'll be right there. Another few minutes passed and still he's chatting up his buddies.

The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.

Came at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon and although there was no line to place an order, there was a 25 minute wait for the food.... I noticed that some people got their orders as soon as they showed up so I highly recommend ordering ahead by phone if thats possible.

The Gaucho Sandwich $15 was amazzzing with its wagyu tri tip steak and chimichuri sauce.  I would definitely order this again even though it's crazy expensive for just a sandwich.  

The Slut $10.50 on the other hand tasted like mash potatoes .  I did not care for this at all. 

For 2 sandwiches and a slut, I paid $37.  Pretty expensive but worth trying if you have not had it before AND if there is no wait.  Otherwise save the experience for another day.",2018-09-03 03:57:48

Crispy beef (Moo Kham Whan) was mouth-wateringly flavorful, super crispy and fresh. Heavily seasoned with cilantro, lime, mint, chili and red onion.

Crab curry--takes like ocean-flavored red curry. And with little nests of vermicelli noodles, it's a must-try. 

Grilled pork with spicy chili sauce (Pla Nua Tod) and the sauteed mushrooms with brussels sprouts (Pad Hed) were also very good.

921,35,4.0,"WHY WE WENT HERE:
- came to Vegas for EDC but our group was staying for about a week in Vegas
- we were a group of 6 but wanted to be comfortable during our stay
- we booked a Bella Suite, which has 2 queen beds and a queen pull out bed - it was perfect for our needs 

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- pretty grandeur

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- huge (from the lobby, to the food court, to the casino, to the many different shops, to the room itself)
- the room was very spacious and the bathroom was too
- I liked how although there was bed room for 6 people, it felt separated (i.e. the 2 queen beds had their own space and their own TV; the queen pull out had its own space with the desk, a dining table of sorts, and its own TV)

CONS:
- no locks on the bathroom
- it would take a while for housekeeping services (i.e. to request more towels as ours got dirty)
- no fridge (there is a mini bar, but it's not like you can put your own drinks or personal food to keep cool in there)
- we had more than enough time to be out and about when we checked in but our bags took a very long time to get to us in our room
- not all of the dealers in the casino are nice; some just already give you that bad vibe like they hate their life - don't project that out onto me",2015-07-16 16:16:41

I have never ever been to any Indian Restaurant and came out so full. Have been to several la-crate in evening and tried lunch buffet today. Every dish was awsome tasty, including Samosa, Gulab jamun, mango custard, Raita, Kheer, DIY Papdi chaat.

Usually an Indian restaurant has few star dishes and few OK dishes, but here we tasted every dish and liked it. Surprisingly it is priced lower than other restarunt, may be due to not-so-great ambiance.

They prepare fresh Jalebi every evening, but I have enjoyed great taste even after a week in home fridge (Just microwave it for 10-12 seconds). There are several Indian sweets on sale too.

Service is a bit slow (or careless) so remind to refill your breads (freshly cooked). You get wheat naan here as part of buffet (a rare feat). You cna't go wrong with this place. Weekend Buffet 8.99 & Kid buffet is $4.99. Looks like week day buffets is cheaper.

I struggled for weeks because I just couldn't deal with driving 10 miles an hour in a 45 or 55 MPH zone behind cyclists riding three across on a state highway. I couldn't imagine trying to enjoy a walk while bicycles fly by me at 20 MPH. What to do? I've always been contemptuous of Las Vegas, But I'm also sick of coming home after a weekend away more stressed than when I left because of speeding up and slowing down for bicycles, rounding a curve and slamming on my brakes for cyclists riding two or three across,  and getting flipped off half the time. 

I opened my mind and accepted the Venetian as an alternative. After several visits for conferences or meetings, I knew that the canal was a pleasant place to enjoy a walk and stop for dinner, so I took the plunge and did something different. It was the best move I've ever made. After just an evening I realized just how much having to dealing with bicycles everywhere else degrades the experience and the general quality of life. Yes, Las Vegas is a manufactured environment, but it's a GOOD manufactured environment. For the first time in a long time I feel completely relaxed after a weekend away.",2013-05-28 22:37:52

It may not be a restaurant,  but it's the even rarer treat of a specialty grocer/deli.  Not only does it have lots of packaged  Eastern Europe/Russian goodies and pickled tastiest and cheeses and soda curiosities and a feast for a curious mind but the meat counter is heaven.  According to the counter gal,  the owner had stocked Whole Foods for years before starting the store and the quality of their wares is such,  I don't doubt her pitch.  

Everything is made in house: from the baked goods, to the hand cured meats and sausages, to the flavorful 'salad' items. And they encourage you to try everything!  Their pride in their work was infectious and even as the lovely sales lady was up selling us on all the things we tried I didn't feel pressured,  just swept away with the delightful turn of an unexpected evening. 

Husband man and I had an easy delicious dinner at home thanks to them and the money we spent on our total purchase (full of additional items for our week) cost only as much as a semi decent dinner out. I will be back and I hope you will take a chance to wander in to their charming home -  so they can stay in business for years to come.

I was impressed upon entering the hotel at how HUGE the hotel was and all the amenities available...the 2 pools (1 which we visited), restaurants, etc..  I reserved 2 conjoining rooms so we'd have more of a group feel, since 8 of my friends were going to be joining us for the festivities.  The rooms and the bathrooms were spacious and accommodated all of us comfortably.  With having 8 girls staying in the hotel room, you need a lot of mirrors especially if you're in Vegas...just to minimize the time you need to get ready to go out and our room had enough making it functional and less time consuming.  

The staff was very helpful and polite at all times.  They were really big on customer service and openly assisted us if we had any questions about anything.

Try the chicken biscuits as an appetizer - it only comes with 2 so make sure you get at least two orders. I got the wedge salad with shrimp but the shrimp were way overcooked. Try the bone marrow as an appetizer as well!

They were all out of a shrimp macaroni and cheese, which was the special of the day, so that was unfortunate.

The room that I stayed at the Venetian are a large suite with a living room for working and relaxing.  A large queen/king sized bed and a large bathroom with a bath jacuzzi that was never used.  Oh yeah....BONUS TIME....three televisions with one in the bathroom.  Imagine watching NFL Sunday or ESPN News while taking a shower, it makes you want to get one at home...hehehe!

Granted this was a business trip and I probably would not want to pay $200+ a night on the strip during a convention weekend, but if $$$$$ was no object, I would definitely stay here more.

Also...internet access is not free and I am a big believer in free internet access to the guests staying in your hotel.  Oh well....one Yelp Star deduction....no big deal this time!

They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. 

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either.

795,322,1.0,"After reading reviews, we decided to finally try Avenue B as it had been on our list for quite some time. I have to say, I found everything about this place to be lackluster. We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can't think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It's possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I'm already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge. There are much better options in the city, both cheaper and better, and I will not be returning to Avenue B.",2017-03-15 01:57:34

We did have their standard suite, but was great enough! A very nice sitting area, complete with a big comfy couch to relax on. Just sunk right into the bed at the end of the day. Lots of closet room and dresser space, and the bathroom was amazing! Wonderful shower and a very large soaking tub. Kind of wished I had a chance to check out that tub! ;p ~

The guest serves were excellent and a late night stroll around the Palazo was magnificent! The hotel itself is amazingly designed and makes you feel like royalty. The pools and hot tub were worth the time out from a day exploring just to relax and take in the gardens surrounding them. Just wear sandels, the concrete is HOT!!

The restaurants at the Venetian sounded very enticing, although we never did eat here. We did manage to sneak in a Gondola ride! Cheesy yes. Touristy...you bet!! But worth every minute!! And their voices are amazing!

The things that stood out on the menu were some Filipino dishes that you're not used to seeing at any restaurant that serves sushi.  According to the waiter, the head chef is a Filipino guy.  The waiter did a very good job selling the stuff to us, but as a Filipino, I certainly knew better than to pay $18 for six pieces of lumpia, or $20 for some pancit.  I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army.  Most of what we ordered was less than memorable and what really stood out were the steaks.  The filet came out rare and the ribeye came medium rare.  Both were amazing!

408,241,1.0,"I hope to bring awareness to our unfortunate experience at Futo Buta to prevent another disabled persons from having to be treated like we were.  We were treated with outright mean spirit and disrespect by our server, Abbey, who did not understand that a disabled guest could not sit on one of the restaurants high tables or on a barstool.

We arrived shortly after opening at 11 am and the hostess graciously sat me and my disabled lunch buddy at one of the tables with chairs and not the tall barstools. The physical limitations of the person I was with inhibit them from being able to sit on a barstool or at a high table.  The server, much to our surprise, started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush. After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly!), the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy.  

It is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved.  We were the first customers of the day.  At this point, there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar. We were not in anyone's way and were not blocking anyone or thing.  We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would.  We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason, but the server did not have one.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch.  

We have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect.  I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities, or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so.  If you do have plan, you should make sure your staff is aware of it.  Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation.

There was a wait for outside dining at 11:30am but we got a nice seat inside where she could look out at the strip and I could watch sports on TV.

A big fan of TV cooking she told me I had to get the Motley Que pulled pork sandwich.  Please remember when looking at the menu that they call chips the British way (they really are fries) which confused me at first since he lives in Northern California.  Not wanting to load up too much, had a Greek Salad and water.  The drinks looked amazing, but being the responsible parent I drank an Arnold Palmer.

Our server, Nichole, was very attentive and got our order right away and refilled my drink 3 times before we left. Sounds trivial, but many times I've had Arnold Palmer refills be just iced tea or lemonade.

The sandwich was amazing and I have to say we were quite surprised at the generous and tasty Greek Salad.  The pulled pork was both crispy and tender and the donkey sauce was nice and sweet.

Prices were quite reasonable.  We also caught a glimpse of the Trash Can Nachos.  They were huge!  That is definitely an appetizer for 5-6 people.  The two people who ordered it barely ate a third and encouraged others to eat it!",2017-04-08 00:29:47

On the plus side, happy hour is decent at half price appetizers, free chips & salsa and cheap drinks. I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend. 

Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.

The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front. 

We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food.

We ordered bottled sparkling water to start. Shortly thereafter another wait staff asked for our beverage order and we ordered the canoe appetizer to start. Within 5 minutes we had our appetizer. We had to wait another 10 minutes at least get our water and even then we had to ask for the water. Being it is hot this time of year water soon after ordering should be commonplace. 
We started into the appetizer and it was room temperature. It got to our table so fast the various components were just waiting to be served but not freshly cooked. 
My wife and I both ordered the butter fish which is a signature dish for Roy's. In years past the fish was silky and sweet with the rice being tender and well seasoned. What we received had been warm and then they tried to caramelize the fish before serving losing they silky texture. The rice triangle had sat around a while and the rice was not tender but dehydrated.

Their turkey was a little dry but I'm glad they didn't skimp on the amount of turkey they gave. I was surprised that they gave a pickle beside the sandwich because I'm a huge fan of pickles but I only ended up eating half of it because of how salty it was.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2017-01-02 03:48:03

192,142,3.0,"I'm not really sure if I like this place.  They're set up to where there are a couple small rooms and each room has a couple tables in it.  It might get a little crowded if you go with a decent sized party (10ish).

The things that stood out on the menu were some Filipino dishes that you're not used to seeing at any restaurant that serves sushi.  According to the waiter, the head chef is a Filipino guy.  The waiter did a very good job selling the stuff to us, but as a Filipino, I certainly knew better than to pay $18 for six pieces of lumpia, or $20 for some pancit.  I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army.  Most of what we ordered was less than memorable and what really stood out were the steaks.  The filet came out rare and the ribeye came medium rare.  Both were amazing!  I'd go back and order just those.

A couple hundred dollars spent for 6 of us was ok.  A little overpriced for what they sold but hey, that's Vegas.",2008-04-28 23:16:34

391,35,1.0,"For starters, the shuttle service took over an hour to come pick us up from the airport. It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The ""resort fee"" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we'll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM.",2011-08-25 04:32:15

360,352,2.0,"The Good:
The casino is visually impressive, no doubt.  The circular layout reminds me of the Hard Rock in Las Vegas, only bigger.  Nice selection of good places to eat, as mentioned in Luckie's review.  Lot's of TV's, although the only channels being shown were ESPN (is there a reason they don't have the sports packages like a sports bar would have, such as NBA and NHL??).  There is a newer electronic roulette table that the old casino did not have, although it only seated 10 people or so.  We were there tonight (a Tuesday) and there were plenty of open slot and video poker machines to play at.  

The Bad:
We are low stakes players.  I enjoy $5 blackjack and the wife enjoys $5 three-card poker.  NO $5 minimum tables on a WEEK-night.  Everything $10 minimum.   The majority of tables were half full or empty.  I'm no math major, but it seems a full $5 table would bring in more rake than an empty $10 one.  We asked the dealer at the empty 3-card table about this and he flagged over the pit supervisor.  Both were friendly, but confessed they did not work at the old location and had no idea they had $5 minimum tables in the past.  The beers were $5 apiece at the bar.  

Summary:
The former Wild Horse Pass definitely catered to the working class, casual player.  The inexpensive, yet tasty, food grill that served a nice variety of foods has been replaced with the Boar Head Deli and Fatburger.  No more buffet.  Five dollar minimum tables gone.  This casino is definitely targeting the higher end, luxury players.  If you're looking to drop $5 a beer, a few hundred dollars at the tables and $100 on a steak dinner, this is your place.  As for us, we'll be driving the extra 20-minutes to Harrah's.",2009-11-04 04:02:06

751,44,3.0,"On the positive side, the food was imaginative, well executed and presented. However on the other side of the coin, the waitstaff is poorly trained and aggressive in telling you what you want, even after you order it your way. For example, my medium rare tuna arrived medium well because I wouldn't order it rare. There appeared to be little service training: when ordering wines by the glass, the waiter said that is what we call it even if it is wrong, when he missed one of the ladies in our party during the drink order, there was no apology just a flip comment from the waiter that clearly offended her. The staff clearly has the priority and walked thru parties while they were being seated rather than taking the 2 extra steps to walk around. It is a shame, since this a nice place with good food at a reasonable price and everyone in our party enjoyed their food but the waiter ruined it for some of us and there are so many good alternatives close by.",2013-01-27 18:16:29
717,79,3.0,"Another star gone, and how strange that this terrible thing occurs the day I become the Duke of chino. 

The food portions thing is bad enough, but the other deteriorating aspect of chino is the service. I remember for the past 8 years, coming to chino was a sure way to put a smile on your face...the people seemed happy to be here, and happy that you were here to experience their amazing food.

The past four or five times I've come it's not even mediocre service, it's downright depressing. The dude waits with little expression as you fill out your order form, as you approach you wait for some sort of greeting, smile, or...well anything. No luck. He grabs the form and says ""$10.20 Jake"". You pay, and that's that. Done. Over. 

Fortunately, as I was writing this they called my name and a woman was waiting with a smile and a few friendly quips...I'm afraid to say that's a rarity. 

This may well be my last visit to chino. I can't stand to see one of the most special places in Phoenix to me reduced to anything less than what it had always been.",2014-02-10 19:41:42

572,291,1.0,"ABSOLUTELY hate this store! 

I've only been in about 3 times to this store but there is a reason for that.  All 3 times I've ever been to the store it seems no one wants to help me. Everytime I've been in, I stand there for 5+ minutes with no one to help me. Not even a friendly ""hello"". 

My most recent visit was to just simply pick up a new phone case for my son.  Walked in, waited, and waited. Numerous employees would walk by, have direct eye contact with me, and continue to ignore me. People who walked in after I had arrived and waited were getting helped right away before me. 

I really don't like making an issue because I've worked years in retail and I know how it can be. But customer service is a big deal to me and if it's a terrible experience, I will give my opinion.  Otherwise how do you learn it's a bad experience. But I decided to let a store employee know that I had waited, was never greeted, and had other shoppers helped before me. This is the last time I'll ever go into this store. I will only go to other ones I've had better experiences at or shop online.

I wouldn't say that it was a bad meal, but definitely not worth the high price tag for what we got.  We decided to share 2 appetizers, 2 main dishes and a dessert, so we could get a taste of several things.  Our bill was $150, and we only had water to drink.  Here's what we ordered...

Appetizer sampler canoe for 3 - one sample per person of 5 different appetizers.  each item was pretty good, and presentation was beautiful...but I'm not an Iron Chef judge, so I'd rather have a little more quantity for the high price.

Kalbi Spring Rolls - fried spring rolls with a Korean chojang sauce (Korean red pepper paste).  definitely not worth ordering again.

Hibachi Salmon - 6 oz. salmon cooked perfectly w/ literally a little triangle of rice on the side.  

Hawaii Short Ribs - 6 oz. short ribs were melt in your mouth tender, and very flavorful.

Warm Chocolate Souffle - ordered when we sat down to allow for 20 minute preparation.  our favorite part of the meal!

Yes, their prices are a bit higher than other salons, but you get what you pay for. What is a few extra dollars spread out over a few months? I'll skip a Starbucks or two to have my hair looking nice every day for months!!!

ONLY other drawback is limited parking.

I echo many other reviews; owner Kandi (sp?) and Jenny are amazing with cut and color in every circumstance. Both perfectionists and always speaking the truth; if they don't think your hair is the type that will hold that color or be right for that cut, they'll tell you! I've overheard them talk to a client who wanted their jet black hair to be a blonde ombré (immediately) and a frizzy, curly girl to have a straight bob. Reality check given and happy clients remain!",2015-01-08 19:20:05

What I do care about is good food and Ping Pang Pong comes through in that department. 

You'll find many of the American Chinese classics you know and love like sweet and sour pork, as well as traditional favorites like fish stew. Everything is masterfully prepared to order in an open kitchen. 

It's also inexpensive. Most entrees will only run you a couple bucks more than what you'd pay at Panda Express.

76,69,3.0,"This is my second visit; my first was back during CES in Jan. with a young friend visiting Vegas for the first time and who had never had a bloody mary...

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

The spaghetti was sticky and old tasting. The meatballs were good. The same for the Salad, it came right after I ordered it, and it was a good salad but again, not fresh.

891,290,2.0,"Oh Shinto, you have so much potential. Sadly, your staff is going to be the thing that brings you under one day. 

I recently tried to order some sushi rolls for take-out over the phone, since I actually really do love their sushi even if it is expensive - hence why I gave them two stars instead of one. The hostess seemed less than thrilled to be stuck there at 1:20 on a weekday afternoon. After being hung up on twice, and maybe I should've taken that as a sign the big man upstairs did not want me to fulfill my sushi craving, I finally decided to call one more time. Well, I wasn't hung up on this time. Instead, I was put on hold for almost 15 minutes. While you might be reading this and saying, ""that's not thaaaaat long"", imagine walking into a restaurant. You FINALLY get a table after being ignored by the hostess for 5 minutes, but then no one greets you for another 15. You would either walk out and/or never come to that establishment again, no matter how good the food. But chances are, that wouldn't happen in a good restaurant with decent staff. Why Shinto feels that customers ordering carry-out aren't as important is beyond me: last time I checked, I have to pay for my food just like people dining inside. After all the frustration and time, I simply told her I had changed my mind, I'd rather take my money elsewhere. Big disappointment.

The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be.

856,197,5.0,"I love how the simplest things garner the most stars on yelp---how else should things be? Bellagio the fountain is nearer 5 stars than the hotel, probably because a Yelp Elite member gave it one star because they're blaming getting sick in Vegas on a strange allergy they have to teflon on the stove tops in the rooms.

So, a mere ten minute fountain show with music ranging from classical to showbiz Leonard Bernstein, this is for sure a must-see in Vegas. It's one of the many throw-ins offered to everyone on the strip, and you've never quite seen anything like it. Vegas seems to have an obsession with wasting water, but they do it in such an aesthetically pleasing way that you just have to say ""Sin City's really got it all"".

Actually, it's a good place to hang out and gaze up at the night sky at the Cosmopolitan, Paris, Aria and other luminescent eye candy scraping the man-lit heavens around you. Extra bonus vibes if you're rolling or getting folkloric.

There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink.

891,112,2.0,"After reading all these reviews for ""Cleveland's Best New Restaurant"", we had such high hopes for Butcher & The Brewer. Man, were we disappointed.

Let me tell you, I was not expecting to have AMAZING service, especially in a restaurant as big and as packed as this place (and since I am a server myself, I feel for these people running around like crazy) and we did go on a night with two concerts and a home Indians game. My boyfriend and I met up with some family friends of his and right when we sat down our waitress showed up to take our drink orders. I love beer, but seeing ""Draft Wine"" on the menu made my heart pitter-patter. My boyfriend stuck with the Farmhouse Rouge, while our friend ordered the Le Boucher and four appetizers for us to share right off the bat. This is, sadly, where things began to go downhill. My boyfriend's beer came out in a regular 12 oz. glass and it was a bright orange-y yellow color. The menu said that the Farmhouse Rouge was an amber, and I even commented how brightly colored it was, but continued sipping my DRAFT WINE (still excited about this). It was also a little hoppy for his taste at first, but the more he drank the more he enjoyed it. Our friend's Le Boucher was a deep maroon color that came in a smaller snifter glass. One by one, our appetizers arrived. The sliders, while a tad overcooked, were delicious thanks to the brioche bun and the spicy mayo. The corndogs were also delicious, no carnival wieners here. The whole wings (which were just okay) were brought out to us by our actual waitress, not a food runner, so we asked about our fourth and final appetizer we were waiting on, the one we were all the most excited about: the bone marrow. She said she would gladly go and check on it for us and that it should be up any minute. Well, that any minute soon turned into 20 minutes. Then 25 minutes. Our waitress came back to see if we needed any drinks, with no last appetizer in her hands. Our friend asked about the bone marrow AGAIN, and changed his beer to a Farmhouse Rouge, which my boyfriend ordered again and I ordered another glass of wine. 

Now things just get a little strange. The waitress comes back and tells us that they are out of bone marrow and have been all night. Considering we ordered the appetizers almost an hour prior and we were just being told this right then after asking about it several times, we were a little iffy. But mistakes do happen, and she said she would buy us the round of drinks we were waiting on for the trouble. In comes my wine, and then in comes the two snifters of a marooney, dark Farmhouse Rouge. WAIT, WHAT?? Right as she puts his glass down, my boyfriend looks at her and says, ""Wait, we both ordered the Farmhouse Rouge?"" and, kind of in a snotty tone, she replies, ""Yeaaaah, that's what this is."" Since he had ordered it before and this obviously was a completely different beer in color, taste, even glass it was served in, he asks what the first beer he was served actually was. She says she's not sure and walks away. Okay then? Today, we still have no idea what beer he drank when we arrived there. It will forever be a mystery. 

We decided to order entrees as well, and all I can say is stay away from the shrimp and grits. The grits, the poached egg, and the large pieces of pork belly were delicious on their own, but they couldn't save the dish from the very fishy shrimp. Instead of being plump and sweet, they tasted almost like shrimp cocktail, the kind you can tell aren't fresh and were probably frozen a while ago. For a $16 price tag, it just wasn't worth it. Come to this establishment for the beer (if you are actually served the one you order), the draft wine (STILL YAY!), and an appetizer, but don't expect stellar service or seafood for the price. Probably won't be returning or recommending it any time soon, and that makes me sad.",2015-07-28 15:04:07

Knowing the caprese skewers were on the lite side, I also got the shrimp scampi.  Together, these two small plates hit the spot.  

Shrimp Scampi- The scampi comes with 8 shrimp in a nice scampi broth with onion, tomato, and a garnish of cilantro. Six pieces of baguette are served on the side for you to sop up the yummy scampi broth.  At first I thought it would have been nice to have 8 pieces of baguette to go with the 8 shrimp, but I was able to make it work and still had some left over to do some broth sopping.  The baguettes are just a little bigger than the shrimp making them perfectly bite size.

One thing to note: if you're not a cilantro fan, you'll want to ask for the cilantro to be left off.  It's not included in the menu description, but there's a generous garnish of cilantro on the scampi.  I enjoyed the cilantro, though there was a lot of it. 

I did not partake in the wine or any of the great sounding cocktails.  There's  a nice selection of them.",2016-12-27 01:17:41

To start the service was amazing. I wish I remembered our servers name but she was really sweet and attentive to our experience. She had great suggestions and I even let her pick my margarita flavor and she came with a passion fruit and pineapple margarita (I think). Lol. We started off with the guacamole, I loved the plantain chips & baby arepas that came with it ! nice change from the typical chips and guac. It was strong with lime with is something that I actually love. we also had the empanadas which were ok. I could've gone without. They're good but not the best. for our entrees my friend had the chicken dish and I had the braised short rib. Both had a super cute presentation and tasted amazing.

We, myself and two family members came in on a Sunday night. First red flag the place was completely empty at 7:00pm. The restaurant was recommended by a close friend so we decided to give it a fair chance.

Roti Telur: 8/10- tasty and authentic (my favourite of the night)
Young chow fried rice: 6/10- nothing special, bland
Singapore fried mee hoon- 7/10- flavourful, but not many shrimp (2 in total)
Lamb Rendang; 5/10- taste of curry not bad, quality of meat was terrible
Sizzling chicken: 7/10: tasty but small portions of meat

For desert we chose the fried banana Grenade, which was absolutely terrible. The bananas were not ripe and the oil in which they were fried had a disgusting aftertaste, indicating it was old oil. We were very unimpressed with this dish.

Overall, especially with the terrible desert and a meal that was $81 for 3 people- this was unsatisfactory.",2016-01-04 06:02:00

Dear Morris Ramen,

I came to you on the afternoon of 9/8/17 with a slip of paper that held my full name, card number, and expiration date. Knowing you do not take reservations, after speaking with the host, I explained and wrote down the 3 customers who would be coming in at 7pm and that I would like to pay for their first round of drinks. (Written on paper with bank and customer info given to host.)

I arrive at 7pm with said guests. Table is sat, I order a round of sake. I am short on time and have to leave my guests before they are done eating. While still at the table, a server quickly drops off the slip of paper which I gave to the host earlier in the day with my card info on it. I ask the busied server ""is this taken care of?"" She says ""yes"".  
Later I receive a text from my friend that she had to pay for the sake I promised to have earlier taken care of. My friend says to me ""they said they don't do that"". 

It has been 30 minutes past with me calling your business number to discuss this matter and to offer my guests dessert as well as a fixed payment, and unfortunately, no answer. 

I am very dissatisfied with this. I stated clearly to the host with my name and phone number as well card info to apply to the check and to give me a call if there was any problems. I was later identified as this person and no action was taken. It was not only embarrassing but unprofessional.",2017-09-09 01:26:19

My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. 

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either.

204,59,5.0,"My friend and I ate here for dinner after our full day on the Strip having fun. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, since there was almost a full house that night. The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.

The crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!

The Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!

My friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!",2017-03-15 02:28:50

789,24,4.0,"I guess it's just as good as you'd expect! Tried the carving station, had a huge pile of crab legs, and a custom omelet. I have a bit of a gripe about the omelets...my fiance and I made it a point to get here before breakfast service ended precisely because I wanted to hit the omelet bar. We got in with about 30 minutes of breakfast service left, and when I got to the omelet station they were already breaking it down and getting ready for lunch. There was only the standard ""huge platter filled with scrambled eggs sitting over a sterno can."" I was annoyed...I complained ""I didn't pay all that money to eat pre-made eggs sitting under a heat lamp!"" Now, I'll give the guy credit...he said ""I'll make you whatever you want"" and so I still got my omelet! That was the right thing to do and I appreciated it. But it seems like I shouldn't have had to complain...most people wouldn't have said anything and would have just walked away disappointed. They should find a way to keep the station open right up until the end of the breakfast service.

Besides that, nothing but good things to say. I had a fantastic mimosa and made myself some sliders on rolls with the meats from the carving station, which were amazingly tender. The crab legs were the sweetest I've ever had...I think the snow crab was a little better than the king crab.

I did call them and after being 20 minutes on the phone they told me you have to order on line. So I go online and try to order and I receive the email that they will get back to me after 10 days. After 10 days they say that they can not send my order because of their policy. 
Long story short, I called them today on Tuesday and talked to store manager name Glen in the Atlanta Store and Told him that I will drive over 250 miles to pick what I need and explained him all the story.

I love the food, truly do, but the service at this location is most certainly 5 points under where it should be. We were taking our friends to dinner to share with them some very important news on a Saturday. We arrived at 6:30 and checked in for a party of 6, was told it'd be a 25 minute wait. At 7:00 I decided to check and see how much longer and was told that my party was already seated. I informed the little hostess that we were not, we were all outside, and she blankly stared at me in disbelief. I asked how much longer and she said probably another 25 minutes. They had my name written down along with what shirt I was wearing and I at no point saw another women with a blue striped tank top arrive with a party of 6 so I demanded to see the manager. Instead of getting the manager she went and got the bartender, who was by no means apologetic for their obvious mistake. Nothing was done or suggested to try and make up for their error and we were left going across the street to Chipotle. I will NEVER be returning to the Gilbert Nando's again.",2015-04-17 22:45:29

The service has varied from decent to bad, and yes,  if you ask to split the check they automatically add a couple extra bucks to your bill without telling you. A little deceiving, if you ask me, but the reason I keep going back is because their prices are great and (some of) thier food is pretty good for a Japanese restaurant in Arizona. In my opinion, it's worth trying out if you don't walk in with high expectations for food and service.",2015-04-28 22:08:34

I completely understand you get a million people coming in and out of your work, but this is your job. So customer servicing people shouldn't be a surprise to you when you decided to get this job! (young lady) 

She wouldn't talked to me, only shook her head yes or no. She only spoke when she felt like it. So when I asked firmly why I couldn't have mango sorbet (after she shook her head no at me) she finally said because it's all out. Do Not shake your head at me in the notion of no!

We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can't think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It's possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I'm already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge.

608,111,1.0,"AVOID. For some reason, everytime I eat here I always get sick. The place is not exactly clean. The kitchen looks disgusting. This is perhaps the worst Denny's restaurant in existence. We regularly stop in, not by choice but due to a family member's preference for this horrible, horrible restaurant.  Well... the food quality is adequate, but smaller than usual portions... and the service is nonexistent. For example:  It's 5 p.m. and there are two employees on duty and that includes the cook. It will take 20 or 30 minutes simply to get a glass of water. 30-45 for appetizers. 2-3 hours for the full meal (not including the time it takes to eat it.)  If you want to eat something, plan on waiting. To be clear, this is not a fault of the waitresses, this is a chronic management problem.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Go to the Village Inn, go to McDonald's, go anywhere else but here. The only reason why this Denny's is still in business is because seniors obviously have extremely low standards and cannot perceive the passage of time. It shouldn't take 3 hours to have a freaking meal unless it's Thanksgiving.  The management and staff who work at this restaurant at absolutely no pride in themselves whatsoever.  They're only there to pick up a paycheck, work as less as possible, and leave. Denny's Corporation is a joke. Luckily, for the managers, the senior citizens who frequent this restaurant are extremely apathetic and don't complain. That's the only reasonable explanation why this restaurant is still in business.",2017-10-11 02:52:19

Goat cheese, pork belly, puréed garlic! Sign me up! We recently found ourselves on that side of town (directly across from the Knights baseball stadium) so we knew we had to go. This place is tucked into an alley so Street parking isn't all that easy; I recommend going ahead and parking in the parking deck. The restaurant is very small and you order your pizza pretty much the same way you order from Subway or Moe's. Everything is right in front of you and they just pile it on...my husband got the meat eater and it's pretty normal- nothing out of the ordinary there but why go to a place like this and get something you can get anywhere?! That's like going to Baskin Robbins and getting vanilla! I settled on the Southern Comfort...a sweeter Alfredo sauce, cheese, basil, pork belly and corn. Added caramelized  onions and the girl making the pizza suggested I put some Italian sausage on it - sure why not! She also said ""I know this is gonna sound strange but when it's done, let me drizzle some honey on two pieces and see if you like it"" Honey? On a Pizza? Ok, I'm game...what a game changer! Omg!

435,118,2.0,"Service and the atmosphere are great but the food lid a little sub-par.  There is a roaming accordion player that is adorable and charming. The menu has a wide variety. My husband I chose classics: manicotti and cheese ravioli- $25.95 each. They tasted frozen and processed- not authentic. 

Each meal comes with a house salad, red and/or white House wine, garlic bread and a cappuccino.  The salad was so-so. It has a slice (like you would get at the deli counter) of salami in it with a hunk of processed mozzarella cheese and is slightly overdressed.   The wine was for sure cheap, but I wasn't expecting anything fancy considering it was included. The meal, depending on what you picked, doesn't take too long to get there but again, isn't anything to write home about.  It seemed like previously frozen, processed pasta- not homemade- with processed cheeses and canned sauce. I've had better at chains. The garlic bread wasn't fresh- seemed like it had been sitting a while and was hard. I tasted the cappuccino and it was ok but had a strong nutty flavor, almost like pecan. 

Again, the 2 stars are for the ambiance and the accordion player than came by our table to entertain.   It's Vegas- there are so many places with much better food for the same price.",2017-01-14 23:14:23

Sangria I has was watery & unflavorful, but got me buzzed. That was part of the point of the drink, but I like a craftily concocted cocktail or elixir & this one was not.

But, (I'm using a lot of buts...) the unchicken & waffles was quite okay. They used veggie meat & they did quite a good job making it like chicken. Since I can't do Roscoe's cause I'm a veggie, this spot did the trick. If Roscoe's was in Europe it would be a different story...

It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet, it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.

Probably some of  the worst service I have received. At least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile, you come back and explain and/or apologize.

Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed! 

I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate! 

The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced.

My chicken burrito was great for it was only $3
I love how they have daily specials for weekdays, it's just awesome when you are trying to save some bucks and still get the great taste and portion

the only downside why I didn't give it a 5-star is due to the kitchen size, the food may take awhile when it gets busy. And I noticed that's why many people call ahead to place the order before they go pick it up

415,1,4.0,"My family has used this ER four times in the past 2 years. Once you get past the waiting room this is a decent ER. The paid staff (docs, nurses, med assistants, etc.) all seem to have their act together (they have ""volunteers"" at the front desk but I don't know what their purpose is because the one I talked to just sat their playing with his phone and wasn't able to provide any assistance to me). The check-in can be confusing because it's all done at a kiosk and during an emergency the last thought on your mind is to walk into an ER only to have your first contact be with a kiosk instead of a human. Lastly, I wish they had an onsite pharmacy that can fill prescriptions in the middle of the night. It's frustrating to spend hours in the ER and then have to go find an open pharmacy that accepts your insurance. Overall though, it's a decent ER.",2017-02-09 06:45:18

I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.

When you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! 

Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!

Do yourself a favor, plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom, have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit, then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires!

619,142,2.0,"We knew we wanted ramen while in Vegas (hot soup in the desert? Oh, yeah), but didn't know where to go.

A fabulous-facial-haired Yelp buddy had written a stellar review of this place, and we knew this was the place to be. So, we made reservations (totally unnecessary) for lunch.

The place was pretty empty at noon on a Sunday, but filled up pretty quickly. We were seated, offered drinks, and ordered from the prix fixe menu.

+First course: Social House green salad with baby mesclun, tomato, and julienne slices of some root vegetable. It was dripping in the ginger dressing. It was tasty, but I wasn't interested in drinking my salad.

+Second course: Tonkotsu ramen, pork broth, a slab of pork, served with a soft-boiled egg and some fried garlic bits. The broth tasted kinda funny, so we added a splash of soy sauce for some flavor, broke open the yolk to add some creaminess, and sprinkled in the fried bits of garlic for some bite. It helped tremendously. I finished the entire bowl. Woo, proud member of the Clean Plate Club!

+Third course: spicy tuna cut roll. Here's where the problem lies: I don't know about you, but I cannot stand it when sushi has creamy ingredients added to it. Save the mayonnaise for sandwiches and the cream cheese for bagels. When I order sushi, I want simplicity; the flavors of the rice, nori, and fish must be able to stand alone, otherwise, I begin to wonder what you're trying to hide with that huge dollop of aioli. End rant. Anyway, with all that said, the sushi was NOT my favorite. Even the shrimp tempura cut roll had a ton of aioli added to the already-creamy avocado. What gives?

The service was great and the atmosphere was beautiful, but what's all that when the food isn't excellent, too?",2012-10-08 17:54:45
15,49,5.0,"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.

I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.

I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 

They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.

Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed.

Sometimes the food was bad...cold green chile pork in a breakfast dish, another time the same pork was in an appetizer that was luke warm.  The flavor was excellent, but clearly BLD is not holding the food at proper temps which is concerning, especially with pork.  I also had an over medium eggs served that had the whites still running clear.  So undercooked and unsafe, I couldn't believe the the kitchen and the server sent it out!

Other times, the service was just OK.  Managers were around, but never stopped by when there was a problem with undercooked or cold food.  Cook times are long. And, I do NOT like the community washroom.  I really don't want to be washing my hands while being stared at by the guy walking out of his room still zipping and adjusting his pants...

I have a bit of a gripe about the omelets...my fiance and I made it a point to get here before breakfast service ended precisely because I wanted to hit the omelet bar. We got in with about 30 minutes of breakfast service left, and when I got to the omelet station they were already breaking it down and getting ready for lunch. There was only the standard ""huge platter filled with scrambled eggs sitting over a sterno can."" I was annoyed...I complained ""I didn't pay all that money to eat pre-made eggs sitting under a heat lamp!"" Now, I'll give the guy credit...he said ""I'll make you whatever you want"" and so I still got my omelet! That was the right thing to do and I appreciated it. But it seems like I shouldn't have had to complain...most people wouldn't have said anything and would have just walked away disappointed. They should find a way to keep the station open right up until the end of the breakfast service.

Besides that, nothing but good things to say. I had a fantastic mimosa and made myself some sliders on rolls with the meats from the carving station, which were amazingly tender. The crab legs were the sweetest I've ever had...I think the snow crab was a little better than the king crab.

The sausage went down nice and smooth. Not too spicy, good snap from the casing, and slightly coarse ground beef and pork blend. That's the texas trinity,  and I never expected to have it be so good in Arizona. Bravo!

Sides: I tried the beans, potato salad, and grits.  Beans were slightly too thick for me. Very hearty if you like it that way. Potato salad was a tiny bit undercooked.  Just personal preference for me..i like it easier to bite through. Grits were awesome though, really tasty!

Lastly, the staff is very nice. I especially love the lady that serves in the line where you order your sides and extras (fries, corn, nachos, etc...). She is amazing!",2017-09-09 15:42:32

1058,305,4.0,"This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem located around 20 minutes northwest of the Vegas Strip. We dropped by for a quick brunch, not knowing how long we were going to spend at Red Rock Canyon. I knew a lot of  people in the area rave about this place so I definitely had to try it out. It was packed to the brim on a Tuesday morning, which shocked me! They have everything from sandwiches to meats to breads and of course everyone's favorite, their pastries. Service was so/so but I would understand because the restaurant was so busy. There are newspapers in the front that look like daily news but it is actually their gigantic menu so it took us awhile for us to decide what we wanted. 

I ended up getting their Smoked Turkey with Avocado, Tomato, and Bacon, which only comes in the bigger half pound portions. Be warned because I was expecting a small bite but their sandwiches are huge and is pretty much 1.5x meals for me but there is absolutely no sharing! Their turkey was a little dry but I'm glad they didn't skimp on the amount of turkey they gave. I was surprised that they gave a pickle beside the sandwich because I'm a huge fan of pickles but I only ended up eating half of it because of how salty it was. With the sandwich, you have a choice of a side, which I chose potato salad and it was on the creamier side, which I didn't mind.  Overall, busy staff so don't expect good service but the food makes up for it!",2017-02-09 07:56:20
85,77,4.0,"This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus ""tapas"" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the ""Halal"" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant. In the meantime go and see Amer and get a taste sensation fix...tell him Nick sent you!",2014-12-17 18:21:11
717,79,5.0,"Yes Chino! The Gods of Chinese, Mexico, and Caribbean fusion have answered my pleas! 

THIS is the chino I know and love, and have frequented since forever. I have in front of me a tin of deliciousness filled to the brim, an extra snickerdoodle, and I'm sporting a gigantic grin that can only be caused by this sort of food euphoria. 

What's more important, the old chino is back on the inside too! And that's what counts right? I was greeted by a friendly girl who offered to help with ordering, and several people were smiling and looked like they were enjoying the bustling Sunday night atmosphere. Speaking of bustling, it was! And it felt great, all sorts of energy in the room and all positive vibes. 

I doubt my previous reviews had anything to do with it, maybe I just got unlucky a few times...but whatever it is, chino is back to its rightful place at the forefront of my mind and heart, and it retakes it's reign as the absolute best and most unique dining experience in Phoenix.

Walking to this display, you get to experience the boulevard as well - real fun going into other casinos and observing.
The schedule is about 15-20 minutes per display, so be ready for the crowds. The street level is one of the best spots, if you get a spot near the waters. I recommend the Bellagio stairs for the view, bit of a distance on the side but a good view. Love the extra boom from the splash of the waters falling back onto the pond at the end, pretty neat.

After walking into a few very expensive bars, I suggested Toby Keith's I love this bar and grill not only because I love Toby Keith BUT i also LOVE country music! 

Once we walked in, I knew it was going to be great night! They were playing dance music during the intermission of a live country band! Their drinks were in mason jars, and the beer was only $8 served in a HUGE mason jar! I ordered a round of drinks and our bartender was extremely friendly When I ordered my 2nd round of shots, I engaged in a coversation with mr.bartender who asked what we were doing in vegas all the way from HI. I told him about my friends bday and he did this fun red yellow green 7 shot pour and gave it to us for free! Then he asked me if I wanted to try! Of course I shouted HELL YESS! Most fun ever!

Located right in the heart of Old Montreal, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot right when they opened on a Friday. We were seated in their covered terrace while the band was setting up. Our server was attentive, kind, and helped us decide what to get.

The drinks were surprisingly strong, especially for noon on a Friday. My Moscow Mule was nice and strong and my girlfriend really enjoyed her smoothie. We ended up sharing the baked goat cheese and the local cheese plate. The goat cheese was wrapped in a flaky pastry and served over a pesto sauce and a red pepper sauce. Really good. The cheese was all local and pretty decent, but it could have been bigger for the price.

118,50,5.0,"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.
Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone. Just text him! He is AMAZZZINNNGG. He will walk you in, he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions.

283,106,5.0,"Initial thoughts upon sitting down with a beer and hitting my first 15 shots: holy cow, I want to build one of these for myself! 

Getting to the nitty gritty of the review and thinking of the questions people would ask before visiting my review becomes a bit more specific. 

#1 * The wait staff was hired yesterday. Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here. They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions. 

#2 * Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out. 

#3 * Computer systems down. There were more error screens than you could imagine here. One of the staff even said the app has never worked here. That's pathetic. Get someone on it. 

My review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said, otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon), which doesn't at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had. 

* Our waitress Michelle was amazing. It looks like she only had two tables, so you can't beat a ratio of 1:9. She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table. 

* The music varies a ton! A good thing! I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music. 

* OMG The food! The food was top quality. Worth twice what it costs. No joke. 



It is blatantly obvious I'm a bullet/list reviewer so here are my key points. 
*Technology- 6/10 train staff and hire an IT person. 
* Staff- 10/10 Some of the most friendly and eager staff I've seen around. Keep it up. 
* Food- 10/10 Id come here just to eat. Period. 
* Overall experience- 9/10 This place was a blast. I plan on visiting as often as I can when in the area. It is totally worth every penny.",2015-01-03 21:29:38

580,188,1.0,"Checked in as a guest of iHeart Radio and the staff at TheHotel aggressively sold us an upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite at the Mandalay. When we arrived at our upgraded suite it was clearly a room they could not have sold otherwise. The room was right over the tram tracks, close to air conditioners and vent fans, and within spitting distance of the parking ramp. The Mandalay staff told us there was nothing they could do and left us staring at at a couple of acres of a rooftop full of air conditioners and listening to traffic, music, and voices from the street. It wouldn't have been so bad if they hadn't SPECIFICALLY told us that the room would be""high up"" in the hotel. BTW, do NOT believe the glowing description of the suites at the Mandalay. At this point I would move to a decent Marriott Courtyard in a blink.

Sometimes the food was bad...cold green chile pork in a breakfast dish, another time the same pork was in an appetizer that was luke warm.  The flavor was excellent, but clearly BLD is not holding the food at proper temps which is concerning, especially with pork.  I also had an over medium eggs served that had the whites still running clear.  So undercooked and unsafe, I couldn't believe the the kitchen and the server sent it out!

Other times, the service was just OK.  Managers were around, but never stopped by when there was a problem with undercooked or cold food.  Cook times are long. And, I do NOT like the community washroom.  I really don't want to be washing my hands while being stared at by the guy walking out of his room still zipping and adjusting his pants...

If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.

Try the chicken biscuits as an appetizer - it only comes with 2 so make sure you get at least two orders. I got the wedge salad with shrimp but the shrimp were way overcooked. Try the bone marrow as an appetizer as well!

They were all out of a shrimp macaroni and cheese, which was the special of the day, so that was unfortunate. Literally a few minutes before that the waiter announced that they had that on the menu and then he had to come back and tell us that they ran out so he should've been a little more prepared.

Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn't smile, didn't say I'll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw).

408,283,4.0,"Beaudevin-All the beauty of wine. 

Great place for a quick bite or a more leisurely tasting while waiting for take off.  This is my favorite spot for this in the Charlotte Airport offering wine tasting and tapas/small plates.

Caprese Skewers- The caprese skewers are served over arugula with a pleasantly sweet balsamic reduction that complements the peppery arugula well.  A simple but delicious and fresh lite plate.  

Knowing the caprese skewers were on the lite side, I also got the shrimp scampi.  Together, these two small plates hit the spot.  

Shrimp Scampi- The scampi comes with 8 shrimp in a nice scampi broth with onion, tomato, and a garnish of cilantro. Six pieces of baguette are served on the side for you to sop up the yummy scampi broth.  At first I thought it would have been nice to have 8 pieces of baguette to go with the 8 shrimp, but I was able to make it work and still had some left over to do some broth sopping.  The baguettes are just a little bigger than the shrimp making them perfectly bite size.

One thing to note: if you're not a cilantro fan, you'll want to ask for the cilantro to be left off.  It's not included in the menu description, but there's a generous garnish of cilantro on the scampi.  I enjoyed the cilantro, though there was a lot of it. 

I did not partake in the wine or any of the great sounding cocktails.  There's  a nice selection of them.",2016-12-27 01:17:41

1326,202,5.0,"This has been my massage place since '08 when I became a member. It took me a while to find the right therapist because I have these aches that need deep pressure and the right technique. Although I tried a few therapists, I eventually found Dave R., who has been the absolute best massage therapist I've ever had - which is why I went to see him exclusively for the past few years. His massages are relaxing and efficient at the same time, he communicates in just the right amount (not too little not too much), he always asks if you feel ok with the pressure, the areas he is working on and so on. He is a very good people's person in that he senses the person and what they need during that particular session. He is particularly good with finding sore spots and   going about fixing them. I went to him so many times with a stuck neck or upper back, and one session was often enough to alleviate whatever ache I was having. He is pleasant, professional and very talented. I highly recommend him. And because he is good, he gets booked a lot, so please schedule a bit in advance. It will be worth it :) A quick word about the facility, they have a beautiful water feature when you walk in which is classy and relaxing, it's always clean, the music is really beautiful and relaxing and the front desk staff is always so amazing. They always greet me by my first name and always attentive during my questions during check-in/check-out. I had to move, but I will miss this place a lot and I hope I can find someone as good as Dave R.",2014-07-02 19:58:39

540,281,5.0,"I try to approach food reviews with a bowl full of practicality.  After all, it's just food right?  Someone makes it for you.  You eat it.  It goes to your stomach and you get full.  The collection of tastes, regardless of magnificence, are quickly filed into your culinary memory shortly after you pay and go on your merry way, reserving a moment to determine the probability of your return.
  
Café Monarch is a place where you can go to eat.   A restaurant by definition.   But to simply lump it into that broad classification is criminal.  Mind you, I despise flowery, over-hyped statements seemingly assigned to all things food (and wine) but this place is so much more than a restaurant.  It left me  desperately trying to grasp and hold the sensations of food, wine, atmosphere, music, service, comfort and how they all seemed to work in harmony to make our visit remarkable.   I'm a practical man and mostly grown up.  I try not to get caught up in hype or revel in the splendor of things like froe gras and Manila clam chowder or something called a Winter Salad which were all among best things I've ever put in my mouth.  But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.  

You will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.  

The lofty recommendation to visit Café Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression.",2017-01-27 20:52:48

We did have their standard suite, but was great enough! A very nice sitting area, complete with a big comfy couch to relax on. Just sunk right into the bed at the end of the day. Lots of closet room and dresser space, and the bathroom was amazing! Wonderful shower and a very large soaking tub. Kind of wished I had a chance to check out that tub! ;p ~

The guest serves were excellent and a late night stroll around the Palazo was magnificent! The hotel itself is amazingly designed and makes you feel like royalty. The pools and hot tub were worth the time out from a day exploring just to relax and take in the gardens surrounding them. Just wear sandels, the concrete is HOT!!

The restaurants at the Venetian sounded very enticing, although we never did eat here. We did manage to sneak in a Gondola ride! Cheesy yes. Touristy...you bet!! But worth every minute!! And their voices are amazing!

1005,88,4.0,"When in Vegas you do things that you do not say and the things your friends shall not repeat!  

So lets say you are at a convention and having drinks when one of the guys tells you he has a cabana reserved at a nightclub called Surrender?  You look around and notice you are 10 guys, but you shrug your shoulders and hop in a limo to the Encore Hotel.

You then get there and find Bobby.  You tell Bobby that you reserved a cabana , give him a credit card and get your ID out to prove that you are twice the age limit which means you will be twice as fun.  The guy looks at you but does not think it is funny!  But as you whiz past the club hopefuls, you take note of everyone in the harsh lighting as you don't want to regret things later. As you enter the club they brand you with the ""over 40"" stamp and walk past the inside club which is dark and out into the shallow pool area which in the dream that I had is littered with young sirens in short dresses on lily pad like tables. It is a stadium-like atmosphere with tables and loungers around the pool and 2 floors of cabanas along the rim. For your money you will be happy to be outside with the big money players who are hoping to get played or to play you.  Fortunately this is only a dream and doesn't happen in real life. 

You get escorted to your cabana and your exotic cabana beauty named Shelley who is made up of what seems like 10 different ethnic backgrounds squeezed into a size zero dress  and 5 inch heels starts pouring drinks.  Remember that you are with 10 guys and the testosterone levels are raging.  Fortunately for Shelley there are scantily clad women lounging all around the cabana waiting for you to invite them over to drink your booze.  You watch as your friends somehow convince them to enter your den of wolves and look foolish.  Remember,  you took mental photos outside.  

Suddenly, like the movies, everything turns to slo-mo as cool people enter the cabana next door and start displaying the cool dance moves you once had before you had that accident where you damaged both your knees trying to ascend Everest for the 100th time.  The women look amazing and one of the guys invites you over and introduces himself.  He knows you are a baller as you shelled out dough to attract cabana babes.  He looks over your 10 homies and asks where the girls are.  You lie and tell him you are celebrating ""Ethan's Freedom and Divorce"".  You find out your new friend is from another club and he and ""his girls"" are VIP hosts and hostesses. And now the females come and introduce themselves and tell you they'd like to see you at their club!  They take some selfies with you and now you see your buddies gazing over.  The myth has now begun and you are a Vegas God for future stories. Lol!

The rest of the night is a blur.  You wake in the morning alone with no chickens or tigers in your room and a full set of teeth. You do have a stamp on your hand and a mouth full of cotton balls though.  Yep, it didn't happen like that.  Those pictures on your phone are fake.

The food portions thing is bad enough, but the other deteriorating aspect of chino is the service. I remember for the past 8 years, coming to chino was a sure way to put a smile on your face...the people seemed happy to be here, and happy that you were here to experience their amazing food.

The past four or five times I've come it's not even mediocre service, it's downright depressing. The dude waits with little expression as you fill out your order form, as you approach you wait for some sort of greeting, smile, or...well anything. No luck. He grabs the form and says ""$10.20 Jake"". You pay, and that's that. Done. Over. 

Fortunately, as I was writing this they called my name and a woman was waiting with a smile and a few friendly quips...I'm afraid to say that's a rarity.

121,55,2.0,Wow. What a sad situation. We came here once before and had such great service. Sadly we chose to come back today and decided to sit at the bar. 3 pm on a Saturday and there are a total of 8 people at the bar.   Service is atrocious. The woman behind the bar could not be bothered to serve the clients as she was too busy ignoring us and cleaning glassware. We ordered the guacamole at $9 a pop and had to ask repeatedly for chips. Our beer glasses were empty for 10 minutes and she finally asked if we wanted more beer. By now I only want water and my damn check. Too bad cuz I thought I found a great local place to go.

Our friends who take us here (who live in Vegas) have a standing Friday night reservation there and they treat them like royalty - the valet saves them a parking spot and they get ""their"" table every Friday. Awesome staff. ""Their"" server is a great guy named ""Papa"". 

They got amazingly yummy salmon and we got the special of the night which was steak and shrimp. So good. Comes with garlic bread and amazing salad, and as I mentioned in my previous review, all-you-can-drink wine. Mmm hmm. Yeah.

690,319,1.0,"One of the worst taco shops I've ever been to- definitely the worst in Phoenix. Their dry and bland burritos lacked fresh authentic ingredients and were replaced by an excess of what tasted like unseasoned beans straight out of the can. The disappointingly small portions of rice and beans would have usually bothered me but after one bite the rest ended up in the trash anyway. 

The service was terrible- and we got it to go! They confused our order, couldn't remember which burrito was which, and while we were waiting we couldn't help but notice how dirty the silverware was on their appropriate abundance of unoccupied dining tables. 

A must skip restaurant in a market that's  abundant with stellar Mexican food in every neighborhood.",2016-02-05 02:50:42
391,35,1.0,"For starters, the shuttle service took over an hour to come pick us up from the airport. It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The ""resort fee"" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we'll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM.",2011-08-25 04:32:15

818,337,1.0,"We had tickets to go see Penn & Teller at the Rio. Since the Rio is slightly off the strip, we decided to head over there, grab a bite to eat, and then go see the show. 

We looked at the lounge menu and saw burgers/sandwiches in the $10-12 range and decided to go for it. Maybe a tad over the odds pricewise, but a downright steal by Vegas standards. 

There were beers listed on the menu, but no wines. I asked the waiter for a wine list. He told me could tell me the wines available by the glass. He rattled off five choices, including two Cabernets. I was not familiar with either of them, but he told me they were ""both from California."" (I head him telling another customer that about her Chardonnay and have no idea why that was supposed to matter. But, I digress...). I picked one of the Cabernets at random. The waiter told me it was the ""better"" of the two. I had no idea what the price was going be, but figured it was probably, at worst, going to be somewhere in the $9 range. (The beers on the menu were slightly above the odds costwise, but not outrageous.) 

Imagine my shock when our bill came and I saw we had been charged $16 for a glass of wine!!!  It was a nice enough pour, but I never would have ordered it had I known it was that expensive. Ok, my mistake for not asking. But, really, that had to have been significantly more expensive than the other wines on the menu and the waiter really should have warned us. 

Yes, our tab ended up being higher than expected, but that does not mean we left a better tip.  We left feeling ripped off and the whole thing put a damper on our evening.  So, what did anybody gain?",2008-12-04 03:12:43

On the plus side, happy hour is decent at half price appetizers, free chips & salsa and cheap drinks. I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend. 

Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.

The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front. 

We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food. 

Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Service was horrible, but they didn't even seem that busy.

927,278,5.0,"Is it possible to leave 10 stars instead of just 5? Because if so, then count this review as a solid and shining 10! I went into Right Toyota yesterday for their customer appreciation event, and was not expecting much of anything at all to come out of it. I was driving a 2007 VW Passat, that looked nicer on paper and in the ads on TV than it did guzzling the premium unleaded and driving like a tank that it really was. But I also was stuck in a bad situation with my finance company over the car too--although I did not know just how bad until Right's finance staff pulled my records up and showed me.

It turned out I was upside down in the car for over 5,000 dollars since purchasing it last year...and that was with making every payment on time and without fail. I had even put down a few thousand on the VW last year, but because of the horrible interest rate I was being charged, my 2,000 dollar credit on the car's value turned to that 5,000 dollar debt in no time. 

I had absolutely no hope whatsoever that I was ever going to get out from under the VW, but salesperson John Tils and his finance team made me an offer I could not refuse: They offered to pay of the entire car loan for the VW, all of it, and get me into a 2010 Toyota Prius for only a bit more than my VW monthly payment was, with absolutely nothing out of my pocket at all. There was a white Prius with grey cloth interior on the lot that I loved, and it just happened to be the one John took me to first. Within two hours of my arrival if that, I was driving away in a 2010 Toyota Prius, and feeling awesome about life for a few reasons...

1. With my job requiring me to travel all across the valley everyday, I now will get more than double the gas mileage I did with the VW, and those savings (not to mention not having to put premium in the Toyota like I did the VW) will more than cover the extra cost of my monthly payments, and then some. 

2. I am now making payments (or will be soon) that are mostly going to the car and not the bank. Even with a credit score in the mid 600's and student loan debt totaling over 100K dollars, the finance team was able to get me in below 10% interest. Also, the Prius has great resale value, which will be nice when the time comes to refinance or sell it. Also, I have one year of free maintenance and 100,000 miles of bumper to bumper warranty coverage, something my used VW did not offer. 

3. Most importantly, I was treated like a member of Right's family from the get go, and made to feel important and valued..but in a sincere and not coerced or forced way. I even asked John exactly why he and Right would want to take care of a customer with little or nothing to offer them in comparison to someone who walks in with capital of some sort, or a boatload of cash. He was honest and straight with me...and said all he and they wanted in return was for me to share my story, in the hope that others might check them out and give them a chance to win their business and friendship too. 

So that is what I am doing, but for more reasons than just because John asked that of me. I have never been treated so respectfully and openly by any auto car dealership business in my life--and lest we forget, these are businesses which we have been almost taught should never be trusted (i.e., the 'used car salesman' cliche)...but just as no one should ever judge a book by its cover, I was both wrong in my skepticism, and pleasantly surprised to be so. 

I truly believe in voting with my feet, and supporting only those personally and professionally alike who are willing to help and support, and help me to better myself in some way...or reciprocity at its most fundamental and honest level(s). I could not ask for better customer service, as well as just human assistance and compassion than I got from Right Toyota yesterday--and look forward to receiving (and giving when able) to Right Toyota from here on out. My hope is that you give them a try too, and that Right Toyota, John and all the other members of their family enjoy nothing but success in the Valley for a long time to come.

Thank you John, and Right Toyota, my day today is a bit brighter and definitely more environmentally, economically, and spiritually friendly... thanks to your friendship and invaluable help:-).",2013-08-24 16:22:21

The Cheetos are not even spicy at all. Too much cheese and no lime at all. It's ok if this is your first time trying the traditional Mexican corn, but if you are use to the soltero keep your 6 dollars and find a real elotero.
The mangoneadas are too sweet. Needs more tajin and chamoy and lime. They literally only put a couple of spoons of chamoy. Need to be more generous with the flavors! I guess it takes a real native to make these tasty foods!!!!",2018-03-15 21:36:32

54,11,5.0,"Before we went to see ""Love"" at the Mirage, my boyfriend and I came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at Onda.  We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.

We were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.

After we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.

We also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.

For our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. 

We ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.

Earlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.

Amazing food, wonderful service.  You won't be disappointed at Onda.",2013-10-24 02:28:30

When we finally asked where my boyfriends tacos were he said they ran out of tortillas. They weren't even going to tell him. Because we were waiting for his entree the rest of ours got cold. I ate half of my turkey burger and it was so salty. Then my friend ordered a coors light and he brought us a blue moon. He then took the blue moon away when we corrected him. He then said we can have one on the house and brought us the old beer back. Dirty plates were left on our table the entire time and he never refilled our drinks. He then said he took the tacos off the bill. When I looked at the bill it only took $5 dollars off the $10 worth of tacos.

I am a Cafe Rio addict and have been going for almost 15 years. I live down the street from this place and drive to a different location. 

My mind is blown that EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I go to this location in person, or call in an order ahead, it's always messed up or not there. Always. A one entree order? Botched. A large to go order? Not even sure if it's ours. A large catering order to go? Missing. I guess I'm the real idiot for coming back.

Entering close to 10PM, we were told in line that dinner service would 10:20PM, however we word be able to stay until 11PM. The food was decent, much better then the Paris buffet that we tried in a past year. I enjoyed the wide variety of foods that they offered. The crab legs seemed popular but I chose not to try it. I did not care for their Kobe beef (most certainly false advertising) as it was tough and chewy. I would also pass on the ham which was dry and salty. However, the assortment of Asian inspired and Italian pasta dishes were savory, with the right amount of oily and creaminess respectively. I also enjoyed their peppermint cheesecake for dessert but was sad they already turned off their ice cream maker at that time. All in all, I was able to enjoy two of the three plates I had and that is enough to give this buffet a thumbs up.",2013-12-29 01:59:39

My husband got the 4 Piece Honey Dipped Fried Chicken Dinner with Baked Beans and Potato Salad as sides. The chicken was crispy even after the honey dip. The baked beans were smoky and the potato salad had a nice hint of mustard. The chicken was quite good for a slightly sweeter version of fried chicken. I got the Meatball Parmigiana Sub with the Criss Cut Fries. The sandwich was tasty. I was pretty pleased with it. The fries were soggy, but I didn't expect them to be perfect since they were delivered to me. Despite them being soggy, they were still good. For dessert, we decided to try something that we both enjoy and then two separate items. We enjoyed the crunch of the fresh Cannoli with the smooth and silky filling. My husband's tiramisu was good, but a bit on the dry side. My chocolate mousse pie was light and fluffy. It was a little dry for my liking, but it was still good. Overall, it was a good value for delivery. We'll probably make a trip to the actual location sometime soon.",2012-03-24 05:54:26

506,302,1.0,"Let me start by saying the buffet, initially, had a much better selection of seafood but it appears they have decided profit was more important than remaining true to their mission. The lunch buffet has turned into a standard Chinese buffet. They no longer offer sashimi, the sushi rice is barely covered with narrow, thin pieces of fish and most of their seafood dishes are typical of other buffets. What a huge disappointment!

They failed to refill the tempura station, even though there was only 3 pieces of bell pepper in the tray, and the sushi chef was so focused on slicing razor thin pieces of fish, he could barely keep up with restocking the platters. I won't be going back to Jogoya and wouldn't recommend them for lunch, unless you want typical, greasy Chinese food. It's unfortunate they have decided to settle for less than mediocre offerings. I'm not sure if Pacific Seafood Buffet has followed a similar path, but I'm not willing to find out.",2016-03-12 17:02:52

My plate looked pretty empty, Denny's gives you more food. My eggs were cold and the bacon was mostly fat. Since my boyfriends food (EGGS BENEDICT PIZZA $13) was free he also ordered a beer. Our bill plus tip was $30. So that's $30 for what looks like a child's plate and 1 beer. My opinion is that there are so many better options and we would have gotten better food for a better price. The chairs, Oh my god, the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in!!

They wanted to remove my gold fillings and replace them with porcelain. I needed 2 root canals and had cavities inside recent fillings. Feeling a gut instinct, I didn't make another appointment. But before I left the office the lady at the receptionist desk, asked me to pay upfront for my dental care plan. Before any work was complete or appointment made. Odd. I called my Old Dentist for a second opinion, whom I'd seen 6 months prior and said everything was good. After scheduling an appointment with my old dentist, the conclusion was made, the dentist lied, about it all. So very very disappointed in this dentistry.

- the best pepper sauce (a very potent green jalapeno / cilantro mixture)

The Service was excellent because I usually measure it by the fact all of our drink glasses were always full.  The attentiveness of staff was 5 Yelp Stars through and through.  I guess we got them on a good night, after reading other Yelp reviews of their service.

The Food was also excellent. Our group ordered 3 appetizers consisting of shoi mai, pot stickers, and wonton yumminess. (Sorry...I don't remember the name of the wonton dish) I ordered my favorite dish of minced beef with egg on rice and everyone else ordered some 3 different noodle soups which they told me was very good for their Americanized tastes.

The Price was OMG - HIGH - $25 per person, not including tip!!  When I eat at any Asian food place, I am really driven by price. I guess it is because I know I can get good Asian food without breaking your wallet.  But I knew about the pricing before I went into the restaurant.  It was really out of sheer convenience of not wanting to leave the hotel for something to eat.  it really was the BEST place for us to eat at the Venetian Hotel & Casino.

We ordered the fried pickles to start with, and wow! I could not believe the size of these things! Shortly after we got our meals, and once again the portions were huge! I finally understood why things were priced the way they were. Everything was sooo good; we will definitely eat here again!",2017-04-07 22:22:34
756,8,2.0,"Food: 3 stars for the price paid.
Service: 1 star.

Been there with a French friend visiting the US because we had a 50% (or 30%?) off coupon which would make the whole day buffet on a Saturday at 25$ (you can get 11$ weekday brunch with that coupon from Tix4tonight).
Not a bad deal. Especially it includes free flow of wines and beers.

First: don't go there unless you have a discount coupon. I don't think the buffet is worth over 20$ (unless you drink a lot of alcohol).
The food is OK, very standard, slightly on the cheap side.
Suchi bar? lot of rice, nothing fine nor gourmet, small selection.
Cheese? industrial, small selection.
Meat? quite oily. American buffet? on the heavy side.
crab legs? yes unlimited snow crab legs. Frozen though and not cooked very well (very salty, watery).
Dessert buffet seemed great. Too bad I don't eat sweet.

I think it's a 3 stars food-wise, for 20ish $.

OK now why 2 stars? Service.
your dirty plates can sit on your tables for 20 minutes. piling up. Our waitress was making a pretty long face and worst of all: she dropped sauce and meat from our plates twice (and a lot, not just few drops), while removing them form the table. Sauce landed twice on your bags that were on the chairs next to us. Not a sorry, not offering to clean, she probably even didn't notice.

You can go there if you wanna eat whole day and don't mind the service.",2015-08-30 17:27:00

Spicy dumplings were so good and came with some rice noodles
Steamed dumplings are very good and so soupy. 
Snow pea sprouts are very good and good portion. 
Beef noodle soup was decent 4/5 star
Fried tofu was a surprise because it's not greasy and it's egg tofu! 
We ordered red bean pancake for dessert and it was 5 star!!

The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.
I will say that the fruit was fresh and yummy (melon, berries, etc.) and the desserts were good, but it wasn't enough to make me want to come back here ever again.",2010-07-07 16:03:41

921,8,3.0,"WHY WE WENT HERE:
- we dedicated the ""only meal of the day"" for a buffet lunch
- the first buffet we went to (which was located in another hotel, I forget which and its name) turned us down because we had several guys in our group who didn't have sleeved shirts on upon entrance

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE/INSIDE):
- hard to miss an open space that has nothing but food
- looks somewhat like a food court

THE WAY IT WORKS:
- go in from the entrance, where the cash registers are
- pay for your meal and indicate how many are in your party
- you are then assigned seating according to how big your party is
- unlimited beer and wine go along with your buffet meal

WHAT THEY HAVE:
- desserts
- cold items (i.e. meats and cheeses like when you drink wine; salad area)
- Asian
- Latino
- American
- Carving
- Italian
- bar
- Seafood

WHAT WE HAD:
- a little bit of everything
- the Latino portion was just sad and not authentic at all
- the Asian portion was fairly decent
- the cold items portion was only good from the meats and cheeses; the salads didn't look fresh
- the desserts were just ok
- the carving and seafood stations were on point! (I wouldn't know about the seafood personally, but a lot of the people in my group kept going back to that station)
- some of the things in the Italian section were selectively better than others (i.e. pasta)

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- the register people aren't pleasant
- the seating attendants are VERY welcoming
- the bartender worked fairly slow and had a hard time remembering our 2 drinks we ordered",2015-07-15 20:25:10

My parents and in laws love this play too! Good for both meat eaters and vegetarians!

Even the pasta & pizza which are normally gross at buffets, was good quality & delicious. The sushi area is great compared to other buffets, the crab legs (cold, but both snow & king) were amazing!

Everything was fantastic, and I will explain... my buddy and I went for a late lunch today (Monday) and there was only a few people there, so for me it was perfect since I am not a fan of crowds.  Next, the decorations are creative, fun and playful... and I had never thought to use holiday light sculptures as a decoration other than a yard ornament, but it is looks great and works for the space.  The server was excellent and attentive; he came back to the table at least 4 or 5 times, and repeatedly refilled our drinks, made sure we were doing okay, asked if we needed anything... wonderful service.  I ate the El Diablo, which was great... really spicy, but I like to sweat and tear up when eating tasty things.  It brought a tear to my eye; but in a good way.  The burger was spicier than I expected which caught me off guard... loved every minute of it.  The quality of food was excellent and matched with the quantity, which was very filling.  The menu had so many things I wanted to try.  The beer list looked great, but need a designated driver for next time.  There appeared to be a variety of root beer options, so a variety of root beer flavors?

They may have fixed the leak but they didn't change the filter which is part of the repair of the leak. The company that came months later to fix it when it broke again said it should have been common sense to replace the filter. I had to have it fixed by another company through my home warranty because this idiot didn't do his job correctly. Their technician was an idiot. He said we needed a new unit which is true but told me they had a special and I could get a new unit for 1500ish which I agreed to and then he speaks to a manager and they come back with a almost $7000 price. The guy never clarified that the $1500 was just a down payment. I understand the high cost of the unit but instead of trying to trick me or waste my time they need to be clear about things. If I could give no stars I would. Seems to me that there are a lot of bad reviews of this company so I don't know why they are still around.,2017-05-17 05:44:55

I've been stalking Eggslut on IG for YEARS salivating over their pics. I've always known they were in LA, but ended up jumping on the bed this morning when I figured out there was a location in Vegas. I was SUPER geeked! I got dressed, walked 18min from MGM to the Cosmopolitan and stood in a 25min line (all things I have no problem doing for mouth-watering food) for a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. While I can appreciate the nice staff and their fast service, the sandwich itself was just not what I was expecting. I would say it's a little over-hyped, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I stood in line for 25+ min for a luke warm sandwich on an untoasted/unwarmed brioche bun. The over medium egg was almost took temperature, and the cheese wasn't even melted. I will say, their house-made turkey sausage tasted very good and the honey mustard aioli was a nice touch. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it better if the sandwich was actually served hot--as it should be. Overall I just didn't get the mind blowing experience that I was expecting.

It was okay but I am assuming since it is still early for pool season the beautiful people have not yet to swarm to Encore Beach Club yet.  It was the first day of work for most of the servers so service was a little meh.  

That being said...  the decor is just so beautiful.  I love the layout.  Very classy and you don't have to worry about getting pregnant if you go in the pool. Unlike Wet Republic or moreso Rehab.

I loved it then and I love it now as it's grown into a full fledged restaurant with many wonderful dishes to offer.  There aren't too many places that make matzo ball soup as good as my own, but Bagel Café's is so good I don't need to bother making my own when I'm here.  I have never had any problem with the servers here, they've all been pretty good with staying on top of everything. I no longer live in Nevada but you can always find me here for my soup and bagel when I come to visit my grown kids.  The prices are little high, but still worth it to me.

Tried this the other day and was put on hold ....waited and waited....6 mins later still no response and I arrived at the location. I asked the server and she said there were only 2 of them and that's why they're told to put people on hold.  

That raises the obvious question...why do you only have 2 servers on an extremely busy Sat morning?...frustrating for customers and got a bit of attitude from the server for good measure....nice!",2017-05-13 14:45:53

Next, the decorations are creative, fun and playful... and I had never thought to use holiday light sculptures as a decoration other than a yard ornament, but it is looks great and works for the space.  The server was excellent and attentive; he came back to the table at least 4 or 5 times, and repeatedly refilled our drinks, made sure we were doing okay, asked if we needed anything... wonderful service.  I ate the El Diablo, which was great... really spicy, but I like to sweat and tear up when eating tasty things.  It brought a tear to my eye; but in a good way.  The burger was spicier than I expected which caught me off guard... loved every minute of it.  The quality of food was excellent and matched with the quantity, which was very filling.  The menu had so many things I wanted to try.  The beer list looked great, but need a designated driver for next time.  There appeared to be a variety of root beer options, so a variety of root beer flavors?

He went back to the kitchen and advised us that our food would be out in five minutes. After waiting another 10 to 15 minutes, the food finally came out one meal short. We were offered no apology or discount for the forgotten meal and slow service. Nothing on our ticket was comped.

254,179,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place.  With the awesome reviews and cool retro vibe, I thought we were in for a great brunch. . Instead we were greeted with a mediocre time.  

Our drinks were good, but expensive. $24.50 for a Bloody Mary...Vegas prices!?!  Whatever.  The bottomless mimosas were just as expected.  The best part was the to-go cups with a fresh mimosa. 

The food.... well, I ordered the Huevos Benedictito, a Spanish version of eggs Benedict.  Great in concept, but not execution.  The English muffin was tough and burnt, the carnitas was hard (how do you get meat hard & dry...too much time under the warming lamp perhaps), but the eggs and sauce were tasty.  At least there was something redeeming about the plate.  And don't even think about getting the hash browns unless you want some undercooked and not seasoned potato strings.  (I think they were potatoes?) They were bland and blended into the plate. My hubby ordered the Beach Bum omelette which looked good and full of veggies. He said it was okay, but he had the same lifeless pile of cardboard shoestring things they called hash browns. 

Lastly, the table had no condiments.  No salt & pepper, no sugar, NOTHING. It's the little things that make up the big picture.  I hope it was just an off day, but I don't think I will take a gamble with giving Tom's Urban another chance. Sorry...",2018-09-25 14:12:47

I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat. 

When we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was ""going to be complicated or not."" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too. 

I had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service. Definitely do NOT recommend going there!!! Don't know exactly which was our original waitress but our checks said Joanne G.

They wanted to remove my gold fillings and replace them with porcelain. I needed 2 root canals and had cavities inside recent fillings. Feeling a gut instinct, I didn't make another appointment. But before I left the office the lady at the receptionist desk, asked me to pay upfront for my dental care plan. Before any work was complete or appointment made. Odd. I called my Old Dentist for a second opinion, whom I'd seen 6 months prior and said everything was good.

204,59,5.0,"My friend and I ate here for dinner after our full day on the Strip having fun. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, since there was almost a full house that night. The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.

The crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!

The Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!

My friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!",2017-03-15 02:28:50

The place is really good for sushi. We got the lunch special which is order an appetizer or nigiri and then 2 rolls for $9.99.  Me and my brother order 4 rolls and 3 out of those 4 were really good...the last one (the triple ocean...I think it was called)...the sauce was overpowering. 

One thing was bothering me was that I got my one order roll...and then got my appetizer....and then my 2nd roll. This was fine but the appetizer should be the first item out...that is why it is called an appetizer. (I do have to say that the gyoza appetizer was lacking seasoning...I mostly was tasting green onions...and that's it)  Like it said it didn't bother me that much because all of our food came out in a quickly matter.

However, the main problem of this restaurant is the decor and layout.  When you walk in...you are greeted by a wall and makes the entrance cramped and unwelcoming.  If they knocked down that wall...it will make the restaurant more 'open' and inviting.  Plus the decor is tacky and the paint seems to fade a little bit.  The ceilings tiles should be clean a little bit.

Overall, the food is good. Service good. Decor...need improving.

1386,291,1.0,"Early December, 2017, a software update showed in my phone settings under General, software update. On 12-21-17 I went into the settings to process the update. It had a bug in it. It wouldn't take my numeric passcode I use daily on the home screen. Same day approx lunch time, I called Verizon who took my monthly payment over the phone then had me reset the passcode in settings to the same passcode. It did not work and I was now locked out of my phone. I could not dial out - only emergencies.  I couldn't call Verizon or anyone. I used my iPad and went online to Verizon and got Zack on chat. I told him I just got off the phone with Verizon who locked my phone and how could Verizon fix it. He asked me where I changed my passcode. I said the settings screen. He said he could not help me and sent me a link for passcodes to work.  
The link says to go to itunes, plug your phone in and click 'recover.'  I plugged it it into my laptop. A message came up on my laptop asking to allow to connect to my iPhone. I clicked yes or allow. It clocked then came up with an error message that it could not connect to the phone. The phone never showed a message on the locked screen to connect to the laptop. I turned the phone off and on. Nothing happened. It still would not take my passcode. 
I immediately left for the nearest verizon store on 7th Street and Bell Road. 
I told a guy there was a software update that would not take my passcode on that screen. I told him I called verizon about an hour ago who had me reset my passcode to the same one and now I'm locked out of my phone. He blamed Apple and said Verizon is not responsible for Apple. He said you need to call Apple or go to an Apple store. I said I need to cancel my account then. He said I couldn't cancel my phone in the store. Your going to have to call verizon. I said with a phone that doesn't work?  He said you can use a phone here. I called verizon and told them the same issue. They blamed Apple. I said if Apple can't fix this, I'm going to cancel my account. She put me through to Apple. The guy said the only way to reset your passcode is to go to iTunes!  I said I did that already. He said for an iphone, you need to reset it until the apple with the cord shows on the phone and press recover. I said I plugged it into the laptop, it clocked. I turned the iPhone on and off while plugged into the laptop and it still did not work. I did it several times. He said I can't see what update you had. I said yes you can. Your Apple then said goodbye. 
I could not get to an Apple store until 8pm same night 10 miles away due to previous plans. The phone started working right when I walked in. It took the thumb print and the screen showed. The guy there said it was probably updating. I walked out of the store a few steps and decided to try the software update that originally caused this mess. Sure enough it would not take the passcode and I was locked out again. I walked back in to the Apple store. I told a young woman working there the issue with the software update not taking my passcode. She said I would have to make an appointment and there is nothing available until next week!  I said no. 
Apple is the one who sent the software upgrade causing my phone to be locked out and now useless. She said their not authorized to change a passcode. I said Verizon blames Apple and Apple blames Verizon. She said I know how you feel. I said Do you? She said I could talk to Apple support on the phone. I said No.  I already did that. That's why I'm here. She said due to the holidays, we have a higher volume and I can't get you in until next week. I said I'm not the one who caused this, Apple did and between you and Verizon I still don't have a phone that works. I walked out. This is unacceptable. They should've taken me that night. They need an accountability and make up for the stress they caused me and right before the holidays. 
Biltmore Apple fixed the problem by resetting the phone the next morning. And yes, they fixed the problem with the passcode even though the young woman at Arrowhead Apple said she Apple was not authorized. Liar.",2017-12-22 19:37:35

There aren't too many places that make matzo ball soup as good as my own, but Bagel Café's is so good I don't need to bother making my own when I'm here.  I have never had any problem with the servers here, they've all been pretty good with staying on top of everything.

My absolute favorite is the fig and goat cheese {oversized} macaroon. When I had tried macaroons previously, I thought they were a bit overrated - a fad that just wasn't for me. Then...my world was rocked. The macaroon was the perfect balance of hard outer shell, soft, moist interior and the heavenly filling of the goat cheese and fig compote. AMAZING. My husband enjoys their cheesecakes, blondies, and weekly specialties. 

Since my first taste, I have been a weekly customer. Usually choosing a new flavor of macaroon and always the fig and goat cheese (thankfully, that is a regular flavor.) You cannot go wrong with Gimme Some Sugar.

1144,33,5.0,"By far, my favorite sushi restaurant in Vegas! It's Brazilian-Japanese fusion, which is very unique. The quality of everything here is amazing and very fresh. I'm extremely picky when it comes to sushi and this place definitely deserves 5 stars. The service is always impeccable and it is super clean in here. It doesn't have the fishy smell that most bad sushi restaurants have. The pricing is very reasonable for the location (inside the Palazzo and on the strip). The decor of the restaurant is pretty in-tune with the rest of the hotel and other restaurants - hip, modern, and a little funky. They have great cocktail selection and a full bar, as well as a happy hour menu. 

SERVICE: 5 Stars.
I've never had a single complaint about the service here. Every time we come here, the service is always consistent and excellent. We celebrated my friend's 21st birthday here with a group of about 20. After ordering countless rolls, plates of sashimi, cocktails and shots, our server graciously brought the birthday princess the 3 Wise Men shots. Doing stuff like this makes you come back because a year later, my friends and I still recant this story and bring up Sushi Samba.

FOOD/DRINK: 5 Stars.
Everything is so fresh and good. I usually order Omakase and my favorites seem to be the Yellowtail, Uni, Fresh Ono, and Tuna. The  Tuna Tutaki appetizer is excellent and something I order whenever I come here. For non-sushi eaters, they have plenty of choices. They have a lot of unique cocktails custom to this restaurant that pair well with almost anything on the menu.

130,35,3.0,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

The outlet's location might feel a bit shady but it is alright, was staying nearby so this was the closest place to grab a bite or two.

Rest everything is what you would expect out of a food chain, same menu, same food, same this, same that :) .. though I was not very happy with the soft taco. Nope not very happy. It was just alright, everything in there right from chicken to cheese demanded an increase in quantity for sure.

The suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.

Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.

I never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).

The restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times), but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu, signature cocktails, wines by the glass, bottles that are sold by the glass, and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day, all night.

I opted for the Day Tour since I was traveling solo and the museum was a bit far from my hotel.  The day tour was also less expensive than the night option. There is a lot to see in the graveyard so I would suggest the day time so you can see everything (not all signs are fully restored with light). Also, I would suggest doing this tour early in the morning if you are traveling in a hotter month - there is NOT shade, but the museum does provide umbrellas to guests if needed.",2018-01-09 22:35:19
996,80,3.0,"I reallyyyy really wanted dessert after eating not the best dinner...and since we were back in the hotel at Paris I decided to stop by here.

The cashier lady was very nice and kind, but seemed to have a bit of trouble at the register.  I think maybe something was broken so it took a while for us just to get to order.

I ordered the Napoleon crepe, lemon custard, berries, chantilly cream, nom nom nom! It was REALLY good, the tartness of the custard and lightly sweet thick chantilly cream worked well together.

Unfortunately they don't fill all the way to the edge so the front tip of the triangle is filled while the back end is just crepe.  Is that how it's done in Paris?  I also feel like they were a bit too thick and eggy to be considered ""good"" crepes, but it was tasty nonetheless. I think the filling just sold me...

$9.99 does seem expensive to me for a crepe since they are kind of cheap to make...but it is Vegas so got to expect everything to be expensive :P

I MIGHT come back here again just for the Napoleon...if I'm ever in Vegas again...",2011-08-25 21:08:26

I was impressed upon entering the hotel at how HUGE the hotel was and all the amenities available...the 2 pools (1 which we visited), restaurants, etc..  I reserved 2 conjoining rooms so we'd have more of a group feel, since 8 of my friends were going to be joining us for the festivities.  The rooms and the bathrooms were spacious and accommodated all of us comfortably.  With having 8 girls staying in the hotel room, you need a lot of mirrors especially if you're in Vegas...just to minimize the time you need to get ready to go out and our room had enough making it functional and less time consuming.  

The staff was very helpful and polite at all times.  They were really big on customer service and openly assisted us if we had any questions about anything.

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.

54,51,4.0,"We had a great stay at the Platinum.  I had no qualms at staying at a non-gaming (read: not a casino) hotel off the Strip.  It's a quick walk to all the action (about 5 to 10 minutes to the Flamingo depending on how quick you pound the pavement).  

The suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.

Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.

I never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).

The restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times), but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu, signature cocktails, wines by the glass, bottles that are sold by the glass, and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day, all night. 

We frequented the happy hour several times during our trip, and we were stoked every visit.

They had prime rib, leg of lamb, bacon, and turkey at the carving stations and an omelet station. The highlights for me, were the prime rib, Chilean sea bass (curiously mislabeled as Florida Wahoo), and the polenta.

The desserts we're also very good, but nothing really stood out for me.

736,33,4.0,"I had eaten at the SushiSamba in Dallas a while back and really enjoyed the food, so I was looking forward to the Las Vegas location to see if it lived up to my food memories.  We had reservations for 9:00PM after the Las Vegas Marathon so my runner friends could get a nice recovery meal that wasn't too heavy.  And that wasn't too far away from their hotel!

We were seated right away, and the vibe of this restaurant was really fun and funky- dark and romantic but with lots of good music.  We decided to split a bunch of small plates which ended up being perfect.  We started with the Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos which were so delicious, but small enough that they left me wanting more!  The tempura mushrooms were light and flavorful with just the right amount of crispiness.  The chicken skewers were YUM but the highlight of the meal was the seabass skewers.  I had these in Dallas and they were every bit as delicious as I remembered.  Love the peruvian corn too.  Normally each order of skewers comes with 2, which would have led to a caveman-style meat fight between the 3 of us, but our server was kind enough to suggest we add a third skewer to the order so we all got to try.  Great service on her part.

We also had 2 of their special sushi rolls- The Pacific Roll and the Green Envy.  Both were very good and tasted very unique, as opposed to a lot of ""special rolls"" you find out there that are just bigger and they charge more for.

All in all, I was very pleased with this meal and would definitely like to go back in the future... but there's so many places to try in Vegas that its hard to commit!",2012-12-04 21:01:25
53,50,4.0,"First I want to say that our group had an AMAZING time at Encore Beach!!!!!  BUT, we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria).",2012-06-26 00:31:09
27,413,4.0,"I enjoyed a dinner meal here especially because it had more variety from Asian to American.
I probably spent a good 30min piling and eating the precut crab legs.  I do wish they had those giant Alaskan crab legs with dangerous looking spikes.  But I only paid $41 so I cannot expect too much.  I moved on to some pasta which the chef made.  Tried some baby roasted pig and a slice of roast beef.  Slice of pizza.  Rested a little.  Ordered more ginger ale.  My waiter was wonderful, my table was always cleaned by the time I came back with a new plate.  Had a plate of sushi rolls.  Had a dessert, small slice of cheese cake.  Went back to get some of those baked fish that just arrived with some yellow colored rice.  By this time I was getting full so I rested some more enjoying my sip of ginger ale.  Got back up to try a plate of fruits, their watermelons were super sweet, some pineapples, cantaloupes, and some fuzzy looking fruit that I don't know the name.  I remembered I didn't have any salad all day so I grabbed a bowl and made a ceasar salad with all the fixings. I got up once again and slowly looked at anything that I wanted to try with my large empty plate and just asked the chefs to give me a little bit of everything. By this time when walking back to the table, I saw a long line piling up outside, waiting to come into the restaurant, so I knew I had to finish soon, to make room for them.  

Overall I had a great experience and enjoyed the variety of dishes that were very tasty and look forward to coming back again. Total Time Spent for Dinner: 1 1/2 - 2 hours.

940,8,5.0,"I seriously can not get enough of this place. Every time we go to Vegas I have to go here. What you get for the price is just awesome.  I don't know how they are not busier. Yea you can go to a lot of other places and pay twice the price and still not get as good of choices as you can here. 

You get bottomless mimosas, plus a wide variety of food. Theres crab, asian, mexican, bbq, pho, and almost anything else your heart desires. This time I brought a friend that is vegan and she was still able to eat like a queen.  The dessert station gets better and better every time we go there. The thing that is a little troublesome is that the plates are always too hot at the dessert station, so all my chocolate melts before I get it to the table. I also think having an Ice Cream station would be super cool too!

688,277,4.0,"I'm going to start with four stars for the Castle. We booked here last weekend and the spot is amazing. I love the feel and the idea of the greenery and artifacts in the back which give for great after-ceremony photos (exactly what most of the venues in the city are missing). My biggest gripe is with their 'soft holds policy'. Personally, I have no issues with this. So, after touring on a Saturday and falling in love, I tell them my fiancé and I will be back the next weekend with family because we want to lock down our October date that is still open. They tell us thats great, set an appointment, but again make it clear they cannot do a 'soft hold'. 

The following Saturday 9 of us show up. Tell them we're probably going to book, and they mention another bride is INTERESTED...There are no soft holds though, so it shouldn't matter-right? So while I'M there touring with my family, the owner calls the other bride telling her there is someone else touring that is REALLY interested (I witnessed the call first-hand when I walked in to their office to ask for pricing to show my dad whom hadn't seen it). The owner is on the phone for a long while, and comes back to say 'the other bride is on her way down (!!!!!) but it's whoever gets the money in our hand first that gets the date, since we don't do soft holds'. When my dad says alright, we're ready, the owner says 'I don't want you making a rash decision because you feel pressure'. 

At this point I'm almost ready to cry out of pure frustration, and tell the owner point blank, 'If we walk out now so you can talk to the other bride, we will not be back'. 

Ultimately we got the date we wanted, and the other bride got her secondary date, and came over to congratulate us after booking. Kudos to the other bride, but hopefully The Castle owners will provide for a better experience going forward and not make us regret investing thousands in this place. 

Will update as things progress, and hopefully be able to increase the stars because I do think the place is absolutely stunning.",2013-12-07 02:44:34

We ordered our Carrot Cake martinis, and we wanted to each pay our own bill, so he gave us a number of 22 each, but the drink itself was suppose to be 18 dollars.  Some paid with credit card and some paid with cash. 

I gave him 25 cash, and I was waiting for my change.  At the same time, I looked at my friend's bill who used her credit card, there was an ""automatic"" gratuity charge of $3.00 dollars added to the bill!!!  I don't know there was this charge when we had a party of 3. 
Okay, maybe there is, so as I was waiting for my $3 dollar change, I did not get anything for 3 minutes, so I asked the bartender, and he was like, I am getting it..... And he came back right away, and tossed it on the table like he was pissed... 
I was unhappy with this service, because that was just wrong to try and keep the change when I did not voluntarily give it to him. In addition the added $3 gratuity!!!

My husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  I'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  The entrees that we ordered were the Jambalaya and the Short Rib Stew.  The Jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.  It seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert I have had in a long time.

He then said we can have one on the house and brought us the old beer back. Dirty plates were left on our table the entire time and he never refilled our drinks.

The couches in the lounge are cool and it one of those places were you could relax with your girl around the faux fire for a couple hours with drinks and just veg out.

The bartender approached us and after ordering our drinks he said he couldn't serve my wife because the manager, who was one of the snickering girls, believed she was intoxicated, which was quite the opposite. The girls sitting around the bar continued to laugh. Obviously we were way more aware than they realized. Normally they have decent bar food and good drink specials but if this how they treat customers they don't deserve business. The biggest complaint is their beer lines taste dirty.

The menu is more than just chicken, beef, pork and fish as each dish is a remarkable blend of palette engagement with bliss. Moderately to expensively priced, and a great place for lunch too!

911,259,5.0,This place was soo amazing!! Came here when they first opened a couple of weeks ago and again tonight. The service was phenomenal as always and the food was crazy good! I love that they have a reg happy hour and a late night happy hour! The chicken tenders are so plump and juicy. I would have never thought to try something called bison meatloaf but holy moley it was so delish (minus the spinach sorry I can't get with the spinach on anything). The spicy thai salad had a pleasant little kick of spice but not crazy crazy spicy  (I appreciate that). The chicken ploblano with tamale cakes was also very yummy. I had a bluberry something martini- that was yum. The white peach sangria- super refreshing and delish. The irish mule was also a pleasantly tasty cocktail. I will say there was one thing I didn't care for that was the turkey meatballs with seeds and such inside (thats probably for a healthier person). EVERYTHING else was soo fricken super deliciously scrumptious I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK. Do yourself a favor and come here the food is great!,2016-10-14 06:49:00

No one kept bumping into us or anything and the other guests were pretty nice! No one thought they were better than anyone at this club, unlike Hakkasan. This resulted in a very nice vibe. The drinks here were pricey, about $40 for two drinks, however, it was good and i was celebrating my birthday so eh, why not? The guest performance was logic and keep this in mind, all of the artists usually performs at 2AM! this is like every club! Hakkasan was the same with Zedd. So if you can, come party here as close as it is to 2AM. I definitely recommend this club. My party had a blast!

619,142,2.0,"We knew we wanted ramen while in Vegas (hot soup in the desert? Oh, yeah), but didn't know where to go.

A fabulous-facial-haired Yelp buddy had written a stellar review of this place, and we knew this was the place to be. So, we made reservations (totally unnecessary) for lunch.

The place was pretty empty at noon on a Sunday, but filled up pretty quickly. We were seated, offered drinks, and ordered from the prix fixe menu.

+First course: Social House green salad with baby mesclun, tomato, and julienne slices of some root vegetable. It was dripping in the ginger dressing. It was tasty, but I wasn't interested in drinking my salad.

+Second course: Tonkotsu ramen, pork broth, a slab of pork, served with a soft-boiled egg and some fried garlic bits. The broth tasted kinda funny, so we added a splash of soy sauce for some flavor, broke open the yolk to add some creaminess, and sprinkled in the fried bits of garlic for some bite. It helped tremendously. I finished the entire bowl. Woo, proud member of the Clean Plate Club!

+Third course: spicy tuna cut roll. Here's where the problem lies: I don't know about you, but I cannot stand it when sushi has creamy ingredients added to it. Save the mayonnaise for sandwiches and the cream cheese for bagels. When I order sushi, I want simplicity; the flavors of the rice, nori, and fish must be able to stand alone, otherwise, I begin to wonder what you're trying to hide with that huge dollop of aioli. End rant. Anyway, with all that said, the sushi was NOT my favorite. Even the shrimp tempura cut roll had a ton of aioli added to the already-creamy avocado. What gives?

The service was great and the atmosphere was beautiful, but what's all that when the food isn't excellent, too?",2012-10-08 17:54:45

We were seated really quickly and had the best waitress named Darlene.  Were waiting for 3 people in our group and while we waited, Darlene brought us complimentary pigs in a blanket.  We also wanted mimosas and she suggested the bottomless so we can try different kinds and kept bringing us different varieties.

The lunch menu did look good but the brunch menu looked so good, we had to go with that.  It's basically small plates and you all share.  There's so much to choose from that Darlene said she will take control and bring us almost everything.  And she wasn't lying!!  We had so much food, we felt bad wasting stuff when we were getting so full!!!!  Everything was fantastic!!  The one thing that we thought would be good was the churro tots.  They were a bit underwhelming, but still good.

391,35,1.0,"For starters, the shuttle service took over an hour to come pick us up from the airport. It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The ""resort fee"" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we'll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM.",2011-08-25 04:32:15

82,74,2.0,"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.",2015-01-03 21:34:24

For dinner my co-worker had both the bold n gold wings and the hot wings. She said both were good but gave an edge to the hot wings. 

I had the chorizo burger. It was good.   The side salad was a generous portion with cucumbers, tomatoes and cheese and not iceberg lettuce (thumbs up)!  The coleslaw was not doing it for me. One bite and that was it. 

Service was great. Drinks refilled timely. Team effort by the servers to make sure food was brought out promptly. Think we had 4 different servers bring us one thing or another. 

Lots of TVs is you want to catch a game and the menu is huge so very likely to find something you would like.

Everything tastes freshly prepared and the happy hour prices are pretty decent! The staff was very friendly and pleasant. The only issue I had was the waiting. When my party first sat down it was several minutes before anyone greeted us. After that it was many more minutes before we got our beverages. The appetizers didn't come for about 25 minutes. The entrees also took a long time. After we were finished eating it was quite a while before our server came back to give us the check. Other than the time issue, everything else about this place was perfect. The decorations inside are beautiful and it is a peaceful and relaxing ambiance. I definitely would recommend this place to everyone, but if you are in a rush, you should probably choose a different restaurant.",2016-01-30 06:35:48

I had the South of the Border cocktail that was pretty good, although I'm not sure if I'd order it again for $13. But the major thing that factored into my rating is that the bartender seemed annoyed we were even there. My friend and I commented on how she didn't smile once the entire time we were there and hardly said a word, until the very end as we left and she greeted a guy sitting down by himself. Maybe it was just us? Not sure but based on today's visit I definitely don't plan on going back.",2018-07-08 00:38:42
1154,35,3.0,"Beautiful hotel, nice interior, absolutely gorgeous rooms, somewhat pricey.

So why the sub par rating? The pool.

Being from southern California, I've been to Vegas more times than I can remember, so we spend most of the days at the pool until we are ready to go out. Needless to say, the pools are a big deal to us.

I have never been to such a dirty pool in Vegas... and everyone there seemed to think it was normal. They said it was sun block, they said a few different things, but there was white crap floating everywhere in all the pools... if you looked at any corner in the pool there would be large disgusting pile ups of the sunblock or whatever... it looked like floating trash.

Everything is nice about the hotel, the rooms especially, but all their pools being dirty like that, and it being seemingly a NORMAL THING for them was really surprising. Not sure if I'll stay here again.",2011-07-29 00:01:27
1031,2,1.0,"I felt like I was an animal at a vet clinic. Went in for my initial teeth cleaning after moving to this area. Dr. Was not personal and busy with other things. Waited for 30 minutes to see the doctor. After that, I had to wait in the chair for another 30 mins to find out my dental care plan. So weird, they told me I had a bunch of work needed to be done. They wanted to remove my gold fillings and replace them with porcelain. I needed 2 root canals and had cavities inside recent fillings. Feeling a gut instinct, I didn't make another appointment. But before I left the office the lady at the receptionist desk, asked me to pay upfront for my dental care plan. Before any work was complete or appointment made. Odd. I called my Old Dentist for a second opinion, whom I'd seen 6 months prior and said everything was good. After scheduling an appointment with my old dentist, the conclusion was made, the dentist lied, about it all. So very very disappointed in this dentistry. If you decide to visit, get a second opinion. I guarantee they have lied.",2016-12-07 23:29:10

875,167,5.0,"First off: I LOVE THIS PLACE!  This place is like family to me and I'll go here for as long as they are in business. Perfect for Indian imported groceries or if you're hungry and you don't feel like cooking, you can dine in or take out delicious meals. 

My favorites: 
Butter Chicken- The chicken is tender, juicy, and it soaks up the color from all the spices and flavors it gets marinated in. The sauce is perfect!

Chicken or Lamb Vindaloo- I've had both. I prefer extra spicy foods. If you like it hot and spicy, I suggest you request them to make it extra spicy for you. It is a hot lava heaven of flavors. The potatoes resemble embers because of spices and the dark red color of the sauce. It's awesome!

Aloo gobi- if you're wanting more of a spiced veggie dish, the cauliflower/potato combo is flavorful, it has a slight little kick of heat.

Gobi 65- The cauliflower dumplings entree. WOW! It's a mild vegetarian dish, but it is warm and comforting. The cauliflower dumplings are in a subtly spiced yogurt gravy, and the best way I can describe it is like India's version of an alfredo sauce with cauliflower. I highly recommend it, it's so good!

Samosas-  Great vegetable samosas! The filling is balanced with the holy trinity of Indian spices like curry, cumin, and coriander. There are even bits of cilantro in it as well. You can never go wrong to order these as a snack or to add to your meal.

Best garlic Naan too, perfect texture and fresh! 

Last but not least, THE BEST EVER!!!
Fresh Pickled Lemon/ Lemon Chutney- This deserves a mention. I've been told these lemons are fresh from the family lemon tree, it's a family recipe. Grandpa Singh won't teach me how to make my own, so I have to come here and ask them for large containers of it or bring a jar because they are the BEST and no other Indian restaurant has this, so it's a rare treasure. LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! Best lemon chutney you will ever find in Arizona! 

In conclusion, I love this place! I love the people! I've tried a few other Indian restaurants and most of them don't even compare. There are plenty of other items to choose from on the menu. This place never disappoints me and it deserves a higher rating!",2017-03-15 03:21:12

405,127,3.0,"Ok more like 3.5 stars. 

I try to be as impartial as possible when trying a new place, but I'm not quite sure what's going on with this place. We arrived around 12:30pm and expected a lunch rush. The place was mostly empty, maybe 6 tables out of 17 had customers dining. With two other parties in front of us, we were told we had to put our names on a list and wait to be seated. It only took 5 minutes to be seated, but given that so many tables were empty, waiting at all seemed odd. 

The hostess is very friendly and delivered menus and took our order quickly. We ordered pho and a bahn mi sandwich and were given the usual plate of condiments to go with it, but it was missing the Thai basil and cilantro. When we asked about it, the server said they recently started omitting these items from the plate and only served them if customers asked. So that is a little weird to me too. 

My dining companion was served her soup several minutes before my sandwich came out, which is also when the iced coffee I had ordered at the start came out. Also weird. 

But as for the food, the bahn mi sandwich rolls are HUGE. Like...American football sized. And they are GOOD! They were a little skimpy on the jalapeños, but I understand not everyone has a mouth made of asbestos like mine. 

All in all worth it for the food, but the service is just a little weird, which is the only reason for the 3 stars.",2018-03-15 20:33:03

Their goodwich is toasted with olive oil rather than butter (at the customers request) and might be one of the most genius methods of preparing a toasted sandwich. I had the Falafel and my god it was superb. A very healthy eat too! And I bought market salad which was able to stand on its own as a solo option for those who eat salads regularly.

You'll find many of the American Chinese classics you know and love like sweet and sour pork, as well as traditional favorites like fish stew. Everything is masterfully prepared to order in an open kitchen. 

It's also inexpensive. Most entrees will only run you a couple bucks more than what you'd pay at Panda Express.

252,35,4.0,"My hubby and I stayed at the Venetian during the week last week. The price was great (169/night) with a package that included $40 off the Phantom of the Opera show tickets! We were definitely planning on seeing it, so it was perfect! There were other discounts in the package (to an Asian restaurant and a Mexican one at Palazzo) but we didn't use those. 

The Venetian...OMG, I loved that place! The perfume scent that others complain about in their reviews, actually wasn't bad...I was worried about it, being highly allergic to strong smelling perfumes, but it was actually really nice...I even miss it now...I didn't sneeze at all from it. We arrived early, 2pm, and they checked is in no problem (3pm is checkin)...Our room was very-very nice, my hubby's jaw sort of dropped when he first saw the room (I booked the whole thing so I already saw the pictures). It was very spacious, from the bathroom to the bedroom/living room...3 TVs in the place! I subtracted a star though b/c our TV in the bathroom did not work :( I was bummed b/c being a woman I spend a LOTTA time in there :) 

The pool area on the 4th floor was very nice (there's another pool with more shade and more privacy on the 10th floor too)...I didn't check out Tao Beach, because I didnt even realize that was in a different area until later. My hubby walked by it and said it was nothing major, so I believed him. There were sufficient chairs at the pool, and the waitresses came by occasionally to see if anyone needed drinks. They could've made more money personally if they came by more frequently. Drinks were good, and the restaurant (Riva by Wolfgang Puck) has really good lunch menu (Pizza was great, and their salads too).

I'm extremely picky when it comes to sushi and this place definitely deserves 5 stars. The service is always impeccable and it is super clean in here. It doesn't have the fishy smell that most bad sushi restaurants have. The pricing is very reasonable for the location (inside the Palazzo and on the strip). The decor of the restaurant is pretty in-tune with the rest of the hotel and other restaurants - hip, modern, and a little funky. They have great cocktail selection and a full bar, as well as a happy hour menu. 

SERVICE: 5 Stars.
I've never had a single complaint about the service here. Every time we come here, the service is always consistent and excellent. We celebrated my friend's 21st birthday here with a group of about 20. After ordering countless rolls, plates of sashimi, cocktails and shots, our server graciously brought the birthday princess the 3 Wise Men shots. Doing stuff like this makes you come back because a year later, my friends and I still recant this story and bring up Sushi Samba.

FOOD/DRINK: 5 Stars.
Everything is so fresh and good. I usually order Omakase and my favorites seem to be the Yellowtail, Uni, Fresh Ono, and Tuna. The  Tuna Tutaki appetizer is excellent and something I order whenever I come here. For non-sushi eaters, they have plenty of choices.

The cashier lady was very nice and kind, but seemed to have a bit of trouble at the register.  I think maybe something was broken so it took a while for us just to get to order.

I ordered the Napoleon crepe, lemon custard, berries, chantilly cream, nom nom nom! It was REALLY good, the tartness of the custard and lightly sweet thick chantilly cream worked well together.

Unfortunately they don't fill all the way to the edge so the front tip of the triangle is filled while the back end is just crepe.  Is that how it's done in Paris?  I also feel like they were a bit too thick and eggy to be considered ""good"" crepes, but it was tasty nonetheless. I think the filling just sold me...

$9.99 does seem expensive to me for a crepe since they are kind of cheap to make...but it is Vegas so got to expect everything to be expensive :P

It's always fun to eat with strangers and you're in this amazing antique store, so there's lots to look at! The food is superb. The buffet is amazing in and of itself, then you get a whole table of cake, plus your meal choice from a separate list! It's incredible! The staff is also super friendly. I would definitely recommend this buffet place to anyone! Be sure to get there early, as there is usually a line and parking can be difficult to find.",2015-08-07 02:27:26

Started off with an epsom foot bath, got a face, scalp, foot and totally body massage, with hot stones. They maximize the amount of massage time. Will definitely return.

Pros: price, super amazing massage, friendly, clean
Cons: no spa amenities, room divided out by curtains.",2018-05-28 23:02:05

754,128,4.0,"Walking in it looks like your typical mexican food joint. Vending machines, small video game arcade.. The colorful decor and a large Pacifico Beer billboard on a wall. 

I was a bit skeptical when I saw an older white gentleman at the register taking the orders, but it didn't stop me. I'm glad I stayed!!

I ordered their chorizo & egg burrito and carne asada tacos. The burrito was very filling and well wrapped in a flour tortilla. It had the right amount of chorizo & egg combination. The carne asada tacos were delicious. The meat was tender, and they  were topped with Pico de gallo, lettuce and guacamole. Very fresh ingredients!!

Great, inexpensive place for 24/7 Mexican food! I shall return.",2014-11-11 19:49:35

The dental assistants that helped in my procedure were amazing, Jewel and Bailey helped me to feel comfortable!  I don't have dental insurance, but they have this insurance through their office you can purchase for $80 something a year and this gave me 25% off all of my dental work, plus they helped me get signed up for care credit which I knew nothing about before this visit!  I highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has!",2016-11-09 20:09:03
856,188,3.0,"I was here in post-Christmas December 2010 and put a lot of things in my body, said a lot of things out of my mouth, and let yet other things hang out of my mouth in here with little to no care. We had a view of the Luxor next door, and an ok view of the strip. Room was about $130 for a King bed, fairly large and hospitable bathroom and separated living room if you wanted to segregate business and ...well, sleep.

The lobby is appetizing and gives you a fair prelude of what you'll have in the rooms, but alas, I still find it a letdown that flat screen TVs are still not the norm in Vegas. But to THEhotel's credit, there is a flat screen, 14""-ish, TV in the restroom so that you could watch from the bathtub, which unfortunately has no jets.

The suite will make you feel like you got a good deal in Vegas, but that you're still missing out on some key throw-ins that should be part of any no-holds-barred sojourn of hedonism in LV---jets in a bathtub, comps for at least a day to a resort, FLAT SCREENED TVs, and slightly sleeker furniture. When your furniture itches your skin a bit, you know you've probably skimmed a little too much and should reassess why you came to Vegas in the first place.

This up and coming hotel can't compete (except for with location) against the Palms, where your bathroom will be fit for the sultan of Brunei and prices for rooms at heights above the 50th floor are comparable if not $10 cheaper. If you have to have the strip, this is a good place to experiment with.",2011-03-04 01:24:21

844,112,4.0,Good food and beer!  Great place before a game. They serve food as it is done so people will get food at different times. Sounds odd but it works. We shared and tasted different dishes. The time between meals being delivered was not long either. I had the cheddar sausage. Delicious and spicy!  My husband ordered the pierogi flatbread. Not bad but only lightly reminiscent of a pierogi. Enjoyed the CLE Pilsner and Repeater brew. There's indoor and outdoor seating.,2018-07-07 22:02:03

478,63,2.0,"Exactly like yelp says for two stars. ""Meh. I've experienced much better."" I was so excited to come here for my birthday. My husband made reservations two weeks in advance for a specific table. Keep in mind, we did not request any of the ""best tables."" We have a small child and requested what must be an unpopular table in the back by the service station. No one bothered to reserve it for us. 

Fine... I'm willing to let that go. We'd been here before and had a great time but even though it was a busy night, I couldn't tell you who my waiter was. Several people took orders, different other people came with drinks, and yet more people came with food. I'm all for working as a team, but we had no idea who our server was, even though we spent over $300 for dinner for 4 (pre-tip.)

The deviled egg app used to be fabulous and now tastes like prepacked Sysco food.  And the clientele is now loud drunks that camp out all evening and ruin a nice place.

506,464,2.0,"My husband and I took our 7 year-old grandsons here, for their birthday, and they loved it! Yes, there's lots to see but, after paying $94 for the entry fee, the prices of the rides and food is highway robbery. The roller-coaster ride (the boys went on) was 7 seconds long and cost $6/person. We did ride the tram ($5/person) and the air tram ($6/person) however, we passed on the swings, water-ride and train (all $6/person). Feeding the sea lion costs $5/person--another pass! 

Food for 4 cost $41. The boys got the kids chicken tender meal (2 pieces of tasteless chicken, a small order of fries and small drink) for $9 each, the other $28 covered 1 grilled chicken sandwich, 1 hamburger, 1 order of fries and a large drink. We also went to the gift shop and, after dropping another $50, left with a 12 inch stuffed penguin, a Beanie Baby hedgehog and another small stuffed something. The $25 penguin sells on-line for 1/2 that price! Granted, it was for our grandson's birthday but we won't be going back!

I came out here a month ago and had dinner here with a friend and his cousins for dinner. It was a really small and quiet amount of people here on a Saturday night. I ordered the spaghetti and meatball dish which was a little bland. The italian bread was really good as the staff served us before our dinner was served. The restaurant is really small with a good outside view of Michaels and several other businesses outside the strip mall. Restaurants meets right by highway 60.

We decide to order the guacamole which was bland and lacked any flavor besides a strong onion flavor (some spice, salt, and lime was needed).

Unfortunately the meal was far from redeeming.  I ordered the beef quesadilla.  The outershell was soaked in oil and unedible and it was loaded with so much cheese that it overpowered the beef so I ended up picking the quesadilla to push everything to the side except for the beef, which was cooked well but could have been seasoned better.

It had an expansive menu which was great for people who have a wide range of preferences in food, however that was unfortunately the only good thing I experienced at Border Grill.",2013-10-03 15:24:04

There is usually a wait to get in which alone should tell you it's pretty great. Highly recommend the queso dip! Fajitas are yummy, you definitely get your money's worth here as the drink prices are very reasonable as well. The only thing that sucked was the waiting area is way too small and you have to be inside to hear them call your name but it's pretty cramped with people and is uncomfortable.

This might be your lucky day"" while looking at his empty dining room. Then starts telling other people who are waiting on a table that they were running out of food. When they questioned him on what he does have his response ""what do you mean. We have a full menu"" but you just said you were out of food.

Went here on a weeknight, so the price was verrry reasonable--it was less than an extra $5 for the other good buffets on the mid-strip area, and the extra few bucks definitely are soo worth it here. I only give this place 4 starts because although the food is excellent, it is the Bellagio after all and I think it is fair to hold them to a higher standard. But still a great buffet and a must-do on the Vegas list, and you can catch the free and spectacularly beautiful water/fountain show outside after you are full from dinner.",2009-05-28 01:06:47
394,69,2.0,"I've come here on previous visits, and was looking forward to the Fire Ball  Wings.  Unfortunately, they are no longer on the menu and were replaced with regular buffalo wings.   They were small and very average.  Providing a tasty dipping sauce with the wings doesn't compensate for small blah wings you could find anywhere.  We went back again 2 days later and tried the Trash Can Nachos.  Ours looked nowhere like the picture and was overloaded with a nasty tasting cheese that overpowered the entire dish.  I never thought I'd use the words 'too much cheese', but this was just nasty.  $20 Nachos should at least taste great. I'll upload a picture of them after posting this review.

Onto the good.....

We had Spicy Bloody Mary's on both visits.  Worth the $15 price each and huge. It's a little inconsistent on toppings, but nonetheless really good.

Service was a little slow on my first visit, but after seeing the Bloody Mary, I understood why It took a little longer, and I was fine with that.

The take.......

Bring those Fire Ball wings back.  Why would you even take something so good off the menu, only to replace them with something people can get anywhere?

Either revisit the Trashcan Nachos recipe, or revisit the staff that are making it.  Who would ever expect Nachos to be bad?  How do you screw that up?  That cheese is pungent nasty.",2018-06-19 15:58:52

354,418,5.0,"Sin City. Poolside bottle service, strip clubs, gambling and what? A Neon Sign Museum. Yes, you heard that right. A Neon Sign Museum.

You know how when you fall in love, you can visualize that moment so clearly in your head? It's a flutter, this overwhelming desire and then certain details just sit with you forever burned into your long term memory.

No? Ok, maybe that's just me. *awkward pause*

Anyhoo, 5 years ago I had come home from work, picked up the mail and was doing my normal process of file, shred, and read when I come across my monthly VIA Magazine which I always peruse through to look for the next adventure to add to my ever growing list. Start flipping through to see a brief clip of the Neon Museum. My eyes ate up these deliciously worn down and repurposed signs. They were visually stunning even in print and it was love at first sight.

Luckily this year I had a conference to attend in Vegas, and I was determined to go during one of the nights, even if I have to go it alone. One of the promises I made to myself this year is ""Imma do me"" and to check off as many things on the bucket list as possible and not give myself excuses as why something can't be done, or needs to wait. Float a Neon Sign Museum visit by some coworkers, and receive stunned looks of ""I'll pass *cough* you're a nerd"", before folks agree to go. I love the people that humor me on my completely random adventures. I immediately book tickets 3 months in advance online.

We grab a cab and oddly enough to head off strip at this hour to the location is about 40 mins in rush hour traffic and we'll miss our timed tour (pre-booked this months in advance ONLINE, not that the place is every really that busy). Calling the museum I only to get caught up in their IVR and get frustrated. My cohort proceeds to laugh at me and then tries the number for himself, of course he managed to bypass the IVR and reach a person without much effort. He gets our situation sorted to where we can join the tour a little late. It's the little moments like these with friends where I think to myself, ""I'm lucky to have you around,"" and with a brief mind hug, I look out the window and am distracted by signs.

We arrive shortly and are escorted to the tour, already in session. As the other visitors listen to the history and descriptions, I completely ignore the guide and physically skip around, lingering near the back of the pack so I can get the perfect shots sans humanoid forms. Sometimes I don't think I care what the story was before coming into contact with something beautiful, I just care that it exists in my view, for me to interact with, add my own personal metadata, love, and appreciate. After all, isn't it our memories that make things special?",2015-05-19 13:45:42

Prices are decent especially for Vegas and the food is delicious.  I have never had something I didn't like.  My favorite was the brunch tapas menu.  For a set price (I think it was $20 for brunch plus $5 for mimosas) you get unlimited tapas and mimosas.  The tapas menu had about 20 items on it and everyone I had was amazing.  I was so full I had to stop.  The plantain empanada, mini burito, and Machaca Chilaquiles were particularly amazing.  My mouth is watering thinking about them.  

The service was also amazing.  We had a group of 10 and it was very fast even with the large group.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating.

592,299,5.0,"Wow can I be more impressed? First of all, if you are a ramen enthusiast, then you have heard about shin sen gumi ramen from LA j-town. Shin-sen-gumi is the crown of ramen on the west coast, so to be able to go up against shin sen gumi is something to be proud off. The tonkatsu ramen soup here taste almost identical to shin sen gumi and I was blown away. Most establishments have really salty or weird flavor soup base like adding butter and garlic for a more western tongue (names I would not mention). The noodle here is the thin style but was a bit more soft compared to shin.  The owner said he could make it more chewy if I wanted to since everything is made by him including the noodles. He also said that his ramen has no added msg or preservative which is surprising to hear. I mean what? Asian food with no msg = mind blown.

Now for the con, the chashu and egg is very average. Here I feel the meat isn't marinated as much and not as sweet. The egg is bland as well like a hard boiled egg, maybe that was the intention to accentuate the flavor of the soup. The place needs more tables also. 

So why did I give 5 stars, based on the soup, noodle, and no msg, this place is on par with shin sen gumi. I support local family business and no longer need to go to la for good ramen. This will be my primary spot from now on.",2017-10-24 20:47:11

I was then asked if I would want ice berg lettuce and cheese on my tacos.  Since traditional Mexican food does not have lettuce, cheese, sour cream, etc, I said no, and asked for onion and cilantro.  Instead I got a pile of chopped tomatoes with little to no onions nor cilantro; which was overwhelmed by the tomatoes.  It's sad really, because Mexican tacos are not complicated.  I've had better tacos from roach coaches in California.  Am I doomed to not find an authentic Mexican restaurant in Cleveland?

We got there late (20 mins later than our reservation), but it was Tuesday so we didn't have any issue.  We got seated at the Bar area, underneath a flat screen TV.  Got to be honest, We were a bit dissapointed at first but after the Olimpics on, it actually helped us to get through the night.  The bartender was our server. So, besides making drinks for the restaurant, he had to wait on us.  He explained what was good to order.  I ended up ordering the Grand prix 3 course meal and my husband order something a la carte.... :) The flow was a bit slow.  We had to wait for the appetizers (Ahi tuna poke) for about 20-25 mins, but it was ok since we had TV to watch so basically we were watching TV while waiting for our food. 
After the tuna poke, the salad was next (couldn't remember the name... it was something with pear on it). It was good but too much cheese. The dressing was good though.  Then, we waited for another 15 mins after we finished the salad for our entrees.  By the time, the entrees r served, I was full and needed space for the chocolate soufle. It was the highlight of this visit.  Although we had better soufle at the Morton steakhouse. After enjoying everything, we ran back to our hotel and ""deposit"" our money to the casino.

A very nice balance of flavors, and the amount of sides to put with the cooked meat and lettuce is wide in range.  Sure it was a bit pricey since my gf only eats at the most chicken, no beef, but if you go with a group it would seem more cost effective.  Still I smashed my face full of as much as I could and walked out feeling great.  Will definitely go back next chance I get!",2017-02-02 04:22:25
367,511,1.0,"Very excited to visit PA and the burg with my good friend tonight. Highly reviewed and highly disappointed...

1st sign of poor management:

Hostess said ""1.5-2 hour wait"" so we went to bar to have a drink to kill time. Actually seated in 25 mins...

2nd sign of poor management:

Bar and restaurant have different menus,
Which means you can't transfer from bar to table

3rd sign of poor management:

Total communication confusion between hostess and waiting staff. Waited 8 mins from notification that table was ready to actually being seated.

4th sign of poor management:

We paid two bills (1 at bar and 1 at restaurant) 

Manager told us we would receive a free round of drinks for the inconvenience. We never received the ""free"" round of drinks the manager stated he would give us for the poor experience.

5th sign of poor management:
Accused the table of stealing a place setting that was located in the bar doggy bag the restaurant placed there...

6th sign of poor management:
Manager had to call police to fix his problem... what??

We respect ALL PA employees who are making a difference... just not the ones at Takeo!

Go to Taco Bell instead, spell it however you want...",2018-04-15 00:06:39

We made our reservation on the day of planned dining and there was a table only at 5:30 (which, luckily what we wanted) indicating the demand this restaurant enjoys. From the moment you arrive to your departure, you are treated with respectful hospitality.  I was tipped off to this when the hostess walked at a slow pace to our table rather than the rush which most hostesses have.  We were seated in the lovely courtyard which smelled of newly bloomed flowers which grew on the courtyard walls.  Our waiter, Steven, was of the highest professional caliber.  He took care of our every request perfectly.  The prix fixe system was great.  We chose the filet mignon as a main course which Steven said would come medium rare unless we requested some other choice.  We stuck with the medium rare and it came just on the rare side of medium rare which we love.  The crab meat fritter in a bisque, which came as the amuse bouche, was delicious.   The salad with compressed melon (which we had never heard of before) was tasty and light.  This is now our favorite restaurant in the whole Phoenix area.",2015-04-12 21:58:15

777,24,2.0,"Heard so much about Las Vegas buffets and were excited to finally try it. However, we were utterly disappointed by Bellagio's lunch buffet. It's hotel buffet, only with more options, at premium price, but not premium food selections or quality. 

Service: indifferent and slow. I had to stack up my plates real high so that they can see it, and would then bother to come over to take it away. This was the case even before the restaurant got busy.

Environment: Clean and spacious. Dim yellow lights are not my favorite ambience, looks tired and aged. Flies flying around, should I expect little friends? 

Presentation: the food looks tired, poorly presented/cut. Look at my photos and decide for yourself, does the food look appetizing?

Food: Uninspired food that are not even up to the standard of food court food. The cooked fish were overcooked and under seasoned. The pizza fillings were generous, but it was average pizza. The sushi were the cheapest quality sushi you can find, no salmon or avocado in it, just vegetables, com'on!! Steak... where's the steak!? In my books, no steak = no buffet, especially premium priced buffets!! Stir fry vegetables, Panda Panda does better, in both taste, presentation, selection and quality!  Egg Benedict, this is my favorite, good hollandaise sauce and runny yolk, yum! But for this to be a highlight is pretty sad.

Dessert: Decent, but nothing exciting and poorly presented. Each slice was cut haphazardly in uneven sizes and rough edges. Sincerely, the food courts does better, at a tenth of the price! 

Price and low down: $28.99 for weekday lunch. If you are eating alone, sure, a buffet here may be worthwhile as you can eat more selections of food. However, I would still recommend to go elsewhere for better value for money. If you are eating as a group, I definitely recommend going to eat at different restaurants, even for take outs. It's better to eat food that is prepared, cooked and presented with care, precision and heart. Bellagio's buffet is quantity without quality.",2017-08-20 03:37:03

We ordered 2 orders of cheese curds -thank god because they are skimpy on the servings. Calamari, frites, and a naked burger, spiced pear sangria and a mulled berry cocktail. I don't think the food choices were that great. Definitely not the place to take a picky eater but they are accommodating. 

The calamari was light and crispy but for almost $12 I would like more calamari and less peppers. The sauce it came with didn't pair well in my opinion. I ended up dipping it in my chipotle aioli. The cheese curds were good, my son didn't care for the sauce to dip it in but I didn't mind it. My sangria was good. 

The service was mediocre. We didn't have a long wait but had so many different people bring us our items I don't know who our tip went to. We dined on the upper patio/balcony and they couldn't use the umbrellas because of the wind but left the umbrellas in the middle of our table so we couldn't see each other! Also when we got our burger with fries they only gave us about 8-10 fries-we had to ask for another side of fries which they gave us on the house.

The day we went it was raining a little, so they didn't give us very much time at some of the stops, and I felt kind of rushed because of this.

My absolute favorite is the fig and goat cheese {oversized} macaroon. When I had tried macaroons previously, I thought they were a bit overrated - a fad that just wasn't for me. Then...my world was rocked. The macaroon was the perfect balance of hard outer shell, soft, moist interior and the heavenly filling of the goat cheese and fig compote. AMAZING. My husband enjoys their cheesecakes, blondies, and weekly specialties. 

Since my first taste, I have been a weekly customer. Usually choosing a new flavor of macaroon and always the fig and goat cheese (thankfully, that is a regular flavor.) You cannot go wrong with Gimme Some Sugar.

However, my trip to Rise & Shine a steak and egg place provided me with one of the best corned beef hash entrees I've ever had.

The owners really spent some time perfecting this simple yet amazing dish.

1177,90,3.0,"Will definitely go back ^_^ The only reason its a 3 star instead of 4 star is how unorganized the restaurant was.

FOOD:
Al Pastor Taco (Station #4) - Delicious!  good pork favor and the toppings made it just right

Al Pastor Vampiro (Station #2) - Really good however i didnt even know what a Vampiro was.. there was no signs to describe it and no one could tell me what it was.  Vampiro is pretty much of a sandwich made of 2 hard corn tortilla, cheese, meat selection, onions, and salsa.   

Lengua Taco (Station #3) - meh, it was okay.  The tongue lacked favored and need to have that seared crispy to make it really good. 

SERVICE: 
The layout of the open kitchen, signs, and where the food trays are is kind of deceptive.  When you walk in it seems similar to Chipotle/Subway, where you start at one end and make your way down to the cashier. 

There are actually 5 lines (Nachos/Burrito line, Station #2 Line, Station #3 Line, Station #4 Line, and the Cashier ).  However the food trays are located only next to Station 4 which makes everyone form a huge line.  You stand in line for whichever type of food you want and than you go to the cashier to pay.  

The staff is polite and some are friendly the only problem is that no one explains what anything is... like a Vampiro vs. Mula vs. Tostada.  All the meats are listed and there are some you know off the bat just due to seeing it your whole life... but there are some i've never seen before.  When i ordered the Al Pastor Taco, the guy asked me if i wanted everything on it, I asked what is ""everything"" and he just looked at me.  I ended up just getting it so i dont hold up the line.",2014-07-13 15:32:05

The food is delicious but not too heavy... I left satiated and not feeling like I would explode (like I do at a lot of restaurants here... not that I'm complaining!)

My friend and I showed up around noon without reservations and were seated promptly on the terrace.  It was so beautifully decorated, you almost felt like you were in a little taverna in Greece and not on the The Strip.  The service was very attentive yet not intrusive.  For the appetizer, I had the Greek Meze Plate which had a selection of tzatziki, some sort of hummus-type spread, and a red-pepper spread with pita triangles, olives, and cheese.  Absolutely perfect in every way.  My friend had the tomato and feta salad which she enjoyed as well.  We both had the shrimp dish which was served with tomato sauce and feta with cous cous.  Loved this as well.  For dessert my friend had the fresh fruit plate (which honestly looked a little disappointing but that's just me) and I had the yogurt martini which was the smoothest greek yogurt I've ever had with a berry sauce on top.  Perfect end to the meal.

Honestly, this was one of the best meals I had on the Las Vegas strip and one of the most delicious.  I will DEFINITELY come back to eat here again... in fact I'm thinking about going there again for lunch tomorrow!  Yes, it was that awesome!",2012-12-04 21:12:12

On the plus side, happy hour is decent at half price appetizers, free chips & salsa and cheap drinks. I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend. 

Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.

The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front. 

We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food. 

Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Service was horrible, but they didn't even seem that busy.

Melissa spent time on my hair despite the fact they were closing. She did an amazing job and was fun to talk to! She even took the time to style it...I have a lot of hair and this is not an easy task. Again, they had closed about an hour earlier. The salon is super cute and tastefully decorated.

46,168,5.0,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Center Cut Steakhouse. New (open since March 2012) to the Vegas dining scene, Center Cut has to its advantage a young, creative, and very talented chef, Ian Delph, who has trained in Sonoma and Boston before taking the helm at Center Cut. Delph seeks out unique, organic, and fresh ingredients that will best compliment the prime cuts of meat featured on the menu. 

A few examples of this creativity include Scottish Salmon with a truffle sauce, pink mashed potatoes that are organically grown and are actually pink, and bib lettuce (that the table next to us ordered) that literally looked like art. Every dish was prepared with panache and flawless presentation. Both my husband and I were completely impressed with the presentation, and the flavors were literally ""melt in your mouth."" The food is nothing short of delicious, and ranks right up there with any of the top Vegas steak houses. In my opinion Center Cut is better because it's not a chain, and the chef gets to use his creative skills a lot more in a non-chain restaurant. We both had a caesar salad to start, and we agreed that it was one of the best caesar salads we'd had in a long time. 

Located inside the Flamingo, the theme is ""old school Vegas"" with a modern and contemporary twist. The Flamingo is one of the original Vegas casinos, and throughout your meal you are treated to still shots of life in Vegas, from the 1930's until now. These still photos are shown throughout the restaurant on multiple TV's and feature the likes of Sonny and Cher, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lewis, Wayne Newton, Elvis... Very cool to watch, and a great compliment to the swanky, sexy feel of the steak house. 

Center Cut has a great wine list too, and we enjoyed our waiter, David, who went to culinary school and is currently training to be a master Sommelier. David recommended an excellent cab that paired perfectly with our meal, and the espresso I had along with the cheesecake was enough to tip me over the edge to give Center Cut 5 stars. Only drawbacks are that the restaurant is open to the bright casino area, and there are no restrooms inside (you have to walk to the lobby area of the casino for the nearest restroom). But the food, the service, and the overall experience are worthy of 5 stars. Center Cut (once discovered), I'm sure will rank among a handful of truly great steakhouses in Vegas. Right now it's still pretty easy to get a table here.",2012-05-20 17:45:00

Pizza seems like the only choice, so it was so great to find a real restaurant by such a great chef open late to serve hungry people. We attended a concert on a Monday and we didn't get out until very late and were needed to eat some food. This place did not disappoint. We got seated right away and our waiter was amazing. He was incredibly on point with the menu and able to answer any questions from our group. My husband and I shared a salad and a burger. I told the waiter that  we were sharing and they evenly split both items, which was really great. The Cesar salad was simple but the dressing was amazing and evenly coated the lettuce. It came with cherry tomatoes and unlike most restaurants that serve things that look like tomatoes but never actually tastes like them, these were amazing, they were sweet and actually tasted like a real tomato. The burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. It came with fries too which were great.Three of us all got  the same burger. One friend got a pepperoni pizza and was very pleased and someone got the crab cakes. Once the food arrived no one spoke, everyone amerced themselves in eating and everyone was incredibly pleased. there were several cocktails - two moscow mules and I had an amazing cocktail here is was a lima sour I believe and it was plum/lime inspired.

That fried rice was legit. Definitely on my must visit list when I'm in the area.",2012-08-27 03:59:13
996,80,3.0,"I reallyyyy really wanted dessert after eating not the best dinner...and since we were back in the hotel at Paris I decided to stop by here.

The cashier lady was very nice and kind, but seemed to have a bit of trouble at the register.  I think maybe something was broken so it took a while for us just to get to order.

I ordered the Napoleon crepe, lemon custard, berries, chantilly cream, nom nom nom! It was REALLY good, the tartness of the custard and lightly sweet thick chantilly cream worked well together.

Unfortunately they don't fill all the way to the edge so the front tip of the triangle is filled while the back end is just crepe.  Is that how it's done in Paris?  I also feel like they were a bit too thick and eggy to be considered ""good"" crepes, but it was tasty nonetheless. I think the filling just sold me...

$9.99 does seem expensive to me for a crepe since they are kind of cheap to make...but it is Vegas so got to expect everything to be expensive :P

I MIGHT come back here again just for the Napoleon...if I'm ever in Vegas again...",2011-08-25 21:08:26

He took a traditional breakfast what I would think of as a ""lumberjack special.""   The plates came with lovely fruit: pineapple and grapefruit and orange, a nice serving and very fresh.

I liked everything so much I went back the next day.  I had banana walnut pancakes, which were much more like cake than pancakes (for me as a US person).  They were scrumptious but so filling that by the time I ate the generous serving of fruit, I could only finish one pancake.

If you're visiting, I'd really go to this location as the other one is very small and the service is less good if you're English speaking.  Also, it's right in the pedestrian zone and across from the art museum.  Fabulous.",2015-08-30 16:32:15

That is disappointing, since this is Las Vegas and we have some great food and drink options in town.

My biggest frustration with the T-Mobile Arena is that they now charge for parking.  I understand that stadiums charge people to park, but in Las Vegas parking has always been free.

The next time that I have to go to the T-Mobile Arena I will simply park at another property and walk over - nothing is that far on the Las Vegas strip!

One other frustration was that all of the people on the upper levels were delayed in leaving so that the people on the lower levels could exit first.  T-Mobile needs to get their act together and develop a better crowd control plan.",2016-07-25 18:36:49

The bar scene is lively but, again, very noisy - you shout to be heard by the person standing in front of you.  The selection of beers is great, and they have a full bar.  My wife and I were with a group of friends making a total of 8.  Fortunately, we were given a table on the patio outside the restaurant.  This was a godsend because it was cool, calm, peaceful, with stars over our heads.  The food was very good and served in Italian restaurant portions: BIG.  My wife's coconut shrimp was somewhat overdone.  My linguine with meatballs was very good. The salads were generous and fresh.  Our waiter was very congenial and efficient.

Crispy beef (Moo Kham Whan) was mouth-wateringly flavorful, super crispy and fresh. Heavily seasoned with cilantro, lime, mint, chili and red onion.

Crab curry--takes like ocean-flavored red curry. And with little nests of vermicelli noodles, it's a must-try. 

Grilled pork with spicy chili sauce (Pla Nua Tod) and the sauteed mushrooms with brussels sprouts (Pad Hed) were also very good.

Yes, there's lots to see but, after paying $94 for the entry fee, the prices of the rides and food is highway robbery. The roller-coaster ride (the boys went on) was 7 seconds long and cost $6/person. We did ride the tram ($5/person) and the air tram ($6/person) however, we passed on the swings, water-ride and train (all $6/person). Feeding the sea lion costs $5/person--another pass! 

Food for 4 cost $41. The boys got the kids chicken tender meal (2 pieces of tasteless chicken, a small order of fries and small drink) for $9 each, the other $28 covered 1 grilled chicken sandwich, 1 hamburger, 1 order of fries and a large drink. We also went to the gift shop and, after dropping another $50, left with a 12 inch stuffed penguin, a Beanie Baby hedgehog and another small stuffed something.

1058,418,5.0,"What a wonderful museum that displays the rich history of Las Vegas! The night tour tickets are a little more expensive but it's totally worth it. Make sure you book a couple days to a week ahead of time because their night tours fill up really fast. Even better, you can buy the package with The Mob Museum by Fremont Street, which I also highly recommend. Just as a heads up, this is a guided tour so you won't be able to wander off by yourself.

The museum has their own parking lot so finding a spot shouldn't be a problem. It does get chilly during the night tour and it's an hour tour so make sure to bring an extra jacket. They are a nonprofit museum so the funding from the tours go toward the preservation of more historical artifacts. You are also allowed to take as many photos as you want, as long as it's for personal use. Just be warned that if you're trying to take pictures of families and friends next to the sign at night, the quality won't be that great because of the direction of the lighting.  

I totally have to give a shout out to our tour guide Ashley from Texas or Louisiana? Just kidding! She's from the Peach State, Georgia. She was very funny but also informative at the same time and I was able to learn so much about how something as simple as a sign played such a crucial role in Las Vegas. 

Overall, a little bit chilly but a wonderful and informative tour of all the signs on the tour. I know the museum is expanding soon so the next time I drop by, I'm hoping to see a couple more signs up. Highly recommended!",2017-01-31 05:54:39

68,63,3.0,"OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now.
Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one. 
Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.
Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.
Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this ""ironic""; I say, ""tacky!"" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting ""Go back to Denny's"", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal.
So, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price.",2014-02-05 18:14:36

We were seated quickly, after a short wait during dinner rush. Our wait staff was helpful and attentive to our needs. It was my first visit, so there were explanations to get my expectations adjusted for how it works. 

The menus are posted around the room walls and are simple to see/understand. The cuisine is much like you would expect for an Italian kitchen. All entrees are served to the table with your choice of wine (red or white) kept at the table, in carafes.  

Our food came quickly, but not before a round of bread that was toasted and buttered and smothered in garlic. I can't be sure, but the bread may have been delivered straight from Heaven. A side salad or soup is offered while waiting for dinner. The salad was a garden variety with Italian dressing. It wasn't large, but it went well with the bread and wine. 

The portions were quite satisfying. I was able to eat all of my Lasagna, and I was happy to walk from the restaurant to The Strip for an after-dinner show. The lasagna was served with a meat sauce and covered with a thin layer of cheese and baked to perfection.

The food is delicious but I've only had Carne Asada tacos and Carne Asada fries. I have yet to try the corn and other meats. I'm sure they all taste great as they look delicious on everyone else's plates. 

The venue also has a condiments area in the middle which is very very hearty with salsas, veggies and a few other fresh accompaniments to your food.

512,40,5.0,I have been going to this place for a few years. They made a point to know my name and it gives me the warm and fuzzies! I would say everything is good except I am not a fan of cold spring rolls. I love the presentation of the pho...you get a friggen salad to make your own little creation. The mango chicken is awesome and something I crave often. They make a great Mango spicy shrimp salad that rocks with a little kick. And their Chicken fried rice has ruined me for so many others. It is so good that I can't eat it anywhere else! Great for Carryout or dine in.,2010-11-22 16:56:54

Appetizers were appealing. Salads had balanced flavor and showed up very quickly. Plates were removed as soon as last bite. Bread and pesto provided but only lasted on the table less than 5 minutes. We had to ask for the bread's return. Entrees tasted good too but were in the small side.

586,173,5.0,"My husband and I used Bill Olmstead and his team for the purchase and sale of our first home with the recommendation from a friend. 

We were incredibly happy with our purchase. As first time homebuyers and moving from out of state we were literally and mentally in new territory. His team walked us through every step of the process and we were able to get something great for our growing family within our budget in such a competitive market.

What really stood out was how the sale of our home went. We had already made a few minor upgrades to the property, but when it came time to sell, Bill gave us a few pointers to polish up the place. Using all of his recommended vendors, we were able to accomplish this in a short time and for low cost. He appropriately read the market and priced our home reasonably, and we ended up selling our home within a few days and walked away with an extra $30,000 cash in our pockets.

Bill was very streamlined, communicative and thorough through the whole process. We would absolutely use his services again if we move back to Phoenix, and we recommend Bill Olmstead's team with the highest regard!",2016-04-11 17:24:06

We had a view of the Luxor next door, and an ok view of the strip. Room was about $130 for a King bed, fairly large and hospitable bathroom and separated living room if you wanted to segregate business and ...well, sleep.

The lobby is appetizing and gives you a fair prelude of what you'll have in the rooms, but alas, I still find it a letdown that flat screen TVs are still not the norm in Vegas. But to THEhotel's credit, there is a flat screen, 14""-ish, TV in the restroom so that you could watch from the bathtub, which unfortunately has no jets.

The suite will make you feel like you got a good deal in Vegas, but that you're still missing out on some key throw-ins that should be part of any no-holds-barred sojourn of hedonism in LV---jets in a bathtub, comps for at least a day to a resort, FLAT SCREENED TVs, and slightly sleeker furniture. When your furniture itches your skin a bit, you know you've probably skimmed a little too much and should reassess why you came to Vegas in the first place.

This up and coming hotel can't compete (except for with location) against the Palms, where your bathroom will be fit for the sultan of Brunei and prices for rooms at heights above the 50th floor are comparable if not $10 cheaper.

I'm only writing this to save you the frustration, and hopefully this location sees this. I'm not sure where the problem lies Bc at this point it's just an issue of competence, but it would sure be convenient for me to come here instead of driving to a diff place.",2018-08-31 03:46:42
824,35,5.0,"By far my favorite place to stay in Vegas to this date.  I've stayed at other hotels including Encore and would rather stay here.  Their ""all suites"" rooms are seriously awesome.  The bathroom is very large and they've got TVs in the bathroom, bedroom, and living room area.  I also like that their sunken living rooms as it makes the room feel even larger. They've got a great selection of shops and restaurants including Bouchon Bakery which makes awesome pastries and Parisian Macaroons.  How the Venetian scored this place instead of Paris Hotel is certainly a mystery, but it sure makes the Venetian a better choice!  Pool area is set up like a typical European Garden.  Wish they had real grass instead of turf as that is really hot to walk in during the summer.  Also, the one large pool gets very crowded which made me question the cleanliness of the water, but it was fairly relaxing regardless.  It's nice that they have various areas with beach chairs that are smaller so you don't feel like your at the pool with 1,000 people even though you are.  They put a lot of thought into the architecture of the place as it is very Italian, and very romantic.  The check-in staff was great and upgraded us from a smaller suite to a larger one for free.  I hope to stay here many, many more times!",2012-09-10 14:48:25
142,111,1.0,"We live near this Denny's and service has been hit or miss so we normally avoid it. I wanted moons over my hammy so we went to Denny's and my husband even expressed his concern. I should have listened. There was one table with 2 people at it, at 9pm at night, that should have told us everything. We stood up front waiting to be seated, there was no one around to seat us. Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn't smile, didn't say I'll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw). Imagine when walked in we were greeted and told they would be right with us. The manager saw us and immediately went to try and seat us while he was in the middle of something. I'm done with the Denny's. You have sealed the deal I won't be back and with the way things looked the restaurant sales won't keep you in business either.",2016-05-19 04:33:26
1659,494,4.0,"We went to Orange Sky for our 34th wedding anniversary dinner.  We picked Orange Sky in part because of the great view of the sunset.  Unfortunately, it was a rare cloudy/rainy evening in Scottsdale.  We started the evening in the lounge, which was very nice.  Windows all around and plenty of comfortable, intimate seating.  Drinks are expensive with mixed drinks around $15 and bottle of beer around $6.  The mixed drinks were very good though and a reasonable size.  You are required to close out your lounge bill before going to dinner, so I don't believe your lounge bill will not count toward the private dining booth minimum.  I should also add that the live jazz trio in the lounge sounded very good and provided nice background music, not too loud.  We then moved into the main dining room, which is nice with windows all around and a beautiful outdoor area, which you can visit during your meal.  Overall the room was very nice, the tables were seated a nice distance apart so it didn't feel crowded at all.  We had a birthday party of about 25 people seated next to us and we could still reasonably hear each other.  The room did get somewhat uncomfortably warm during the evening, which detracted from the enjoyment of the evening.  Service during the evening was very good, but not flawless.  Our primary waiter was very nice and provided answers to our questions about the food.  Our water was kept full without asking.  We did have to slice up our shared appetizer and pour our own wine refills.  And when the food arrived it was a bit awkward placing all the dishes on the table.  the food was the highlight of the evening.  We had two different entrees - wild boar ($34) and skirt steak ($29).  Both were outstanding - flavorful and just as described by our waiter.  I had a good sized portion of the wild boar, probably close to 10 ounces, which was tender and served with gnocci. We had three sides, the cauliflower gratin, the sweet potatoes, and the crushed potatoes.  These were all good but not great, but were definitely enough for two as stated in the menu, and were around $10 each.  Complimentary bread was also served with meal, which was good but just two types of simple bread.  We had a bottle of wine with dinner, Fess Parker 2014 Syrah, which was very good and reasonably priced at $45.  We did not order dessert, were given a small complimentary dessert in honor of our anniversary, which was very nice.  I believe our total bill including pre-dinner drinks, wine, appetizer, 3 entrees and 3 sides was around $300 including tax and tip.  Overall, it was a very nice evening and I would defintely return to Orange Sky for a special dinner.",2017-07-16 14:44:27

For dinner my co-worker had both the bold n gold wings and the hot wings. She said both were good but gave an edge to the hot wings. 

I had the chorizo burger. It was good.   The side salad was a generous portion with cucumbers, tomatoes and cheese and not iceberg lettuce (thumbs up)!  The coleslaw was not doing it for me. One bite and that was it. 

Service was great. Drinks refilled timely. Team effort by the servers to make sure food was brought out promptly. Think we had 4 different servers bring us one thing or another. 

Lots of TVs is you want to catch a game and the menu is huge so very likely to find something you would like.

653,275,5.0,"Recently had my sons birthday here.  I like this place much better than Sky Zone!  It's much more open and not crowded, even with open jump and other birthday parties.  Our hostess was awesome. They customize shirts for the birthday boy. Our hostess drew an awesome Super Mario shirt. The birthday party included a private dodge ball game which was so much fun. We played a few rounds and then she let us jump privately because there was no party after us.
The place feels so clean. They have a free place for your shoes and belongings and seats all around so you can watch your kids jump if you aren't jumping too, where at Sky Zone you see parents standing at the entrance or sitting on the ground in those narrow walkways. The regular jump area is nice and open and they have a separate netted off area for younger kids that the parents can also jump in. Unlike Sky Zone that have small kids to one side, 8-10 yr olds in the middle and adults to the other side. 
It's very sensory friendly also. I wish FEAT would consider hosting family nights there. I only wish they would open a location closer to my side of town.",2016-10-13 22:03:35
946,257,5.0,I was visiting from out of town.  Found this place in a newspaper article online while searching for gluten free bakeries and they were open on Sunday.  The inside was very comfy and they had outside seating.  The entire place is 100% gluten free so I would have come hungry for lunch/brunch if I had known.  They had some vegan items marked and some more they told me about.  Great safe food place!,2014-03-07 00:03:25
1579,479,1.0,"First off the customer service was just not up to par. Decided to do a call in order and was met by extreme attitude and was told I had the option of paying over the phone, I decided I would rather pay in person since I don't like giving my card number over the phone. The lady hung up on me before I could get an ETA on my food and confirm my order. I called back and was told they would not begin my order until I paid (so what's the point of calling ahead), told them I only lived 5 minutes away and would be there shortly to which they reluctantly agreed to begin my order. On arrival the lady at the counter was very short with us and couldn't wait to have us leave. When we got home the traditional wings were dry and the boneless were soggy. I will say I enjoyed the sauce but that's about it. For the quality and customer service I would also say it's over priced, 2 and a half dozen wings was nearly $30 with no sides or drinks. I am willing to pay extra for my food if I feel the customer service and quality back it up, but that is not the case at ATL Wings.",2016-09-21 01:41:36

693,446,3.0,"visited this ""original"" location with friends from work.  atmosphere was decent.  if u are of ""darker"" complection, u get weird looks from other patrons.  i mean, we ""stood out"" a bit, but folks here are a bit obvious with their ""weird"" looks.  anyhow, I'm giving this place 3 stars and here's the breakdown:

food:  4 stars good portion size. that's if you stick to anything ""american"".  Example was a friend ordered the Tandoori Chicken plate... well, there's nothing Tandoori about it.  The chicken looked like they came off the grill (which is not how tandoori's are done) and had some spices thrown on top of it.  She didn't like it.  the bback ribs were excellent however.  Again if you stick to the ""american"" grub you'll be fine.  Another friend ordered the rib eye medium-well, it was a bit over done.

atmosphere:  3 stars.  decent typical bar scene in a college town/business district.  nothing spectacular but then again, you wouldn't expect anything more or anything less.

service:  1 star.  we had an extremely rude server who gave us attitude as soon as we sat down.  it appeared he was not happy about having out-of-town business type people because as soon as we asked for separate checks, he threw an attitude and was quite rude.  rolled his eyes a couple times!!! he was ""special"" and if you do visit this joint and get Eric as ur server, look out!!!

This place could have been better but again, if you can look pass the annoyances and focus on the food, you'll definitely like this place.

BTW, the microbrew was not too shabby.  the beer sampler was pretty good.

290,428,1.0,"Came here for dinner. Quick seating and low price $20.
The atmosphere feels very old-medieval-esque. To my taste, too dull and quiet. Not too many young people either. Mainly middle-aged and on, or small families.
My waitress wasn't responsive. Once we had our order of drinks, that was it, she never returned.
The food selection is mediocre. Most of the chefs don't smile and seem to growl every time you request something.
There's a Mongolian section where you select your vegetables and your meat option. The chef makes the plate of food for you within 5 minutes. But, the leftover food bits from the previous order(s) weren't fully scraped off. Had little black bits throughout my plate. Hate to waste food, but definitely not risking my stomach.
Best choice for me was the porkchops. Soft and tasty. Everything else, meh. Even the desserts weren't to par.

We got there during the dinner ""rush hour"" (long lines, awkwardly standing  in line while breathing down the other person's neck and glaring at those who cut in front for one dish). But dang, the food was awesome. And their selection was far out. I think I tried some new never before had food there such as quail and ostrich (?!).

603,15,3.0,"Lucky Foo's... My wife and I love you, but we're breaking up with you.  We've been here 6 times now (3 check-ins on yelp) but you have a chronic glaring service problem that we have to consciously prepare ourselves (and friends we bring) for- every time we come.  And, we're not sure we'll be back again because of it.

Arrival was nice- hostess walked to the front, greeted us, confirms reservation and sat us, per usual.

Today is Valentine's day, and my wife made a reservation for a 1pm brunch.
We sat down and it might have been (trying to be favorable to the restaurant here) at least 10 minutes before someone came and asked if we'd like to start with drinks.  My wife a bloody mary and water, myself- an espresso and water.
We also ordered starters but said we were not ready to order entrees yet.

Water was served shortly after, and the bloody mary shortly after that.  Espresso never came.  

25 minutes in:  
Starters were served and the gentlemen putting them on the table asked if he could take our menus, and I informed him that we hadn't ordered yet.  The gentleman says ""Oh, i thought you already had!"" Correct sir, I feel like we already should have, but the waitress never came back to check in for 15 minutes after taking the starters and drinks.
Waitress comes: my wife orders the Lox with a side egg.  I order the poached eggs.

40 minutes in: Finished our starters.  No one has checked in at the table.  Still no espresso.  The young girl finally checked in to see if we wanted more water, and I asked if she could check on the espresso.  She did- came back and stated they were out of stock.  I wasn't that invested so I requested no substitute drink- they did offer. 

50 minutes in:  My food is delivered- my wife's side of egg is delivered, and at THAT moment is when they inform us that they are out of stock on the lox, so they never made her plate!  At no time previously did the come out and present this, so she might adjust her order & we could eat together- on Valentine's day.  she passed on a change of order at this juncture, because we agree'd that it would have been more of a hassle to try to order something else at this time.

75 minutes in:  I finish eating.  Fortunately the starters helped my wife not be so annoyed that she didn't have a proper meal.  We're about to ask for the check when suddenly the woman, that I can assume should be our waitress, brings out an espresso!  She said there had been trouble with the machine.  I'm agreeable- I enjoy a cup at the end of the meal just as much as the start.
No coffee accessories were delivered. I know that espresso is usually straight, but it wasn't offered either. 

I'm pretty laissez-faire about things when it comes to service.  My wife- less so.  I just want to enjoy some good food and company, but this inability to inform us that things are out of stock, or that you're having issues, and allowing us to change our minds so we may still have a nice Valentine's brunch together, did rub me the wrong way.  I should not have to even think about the service.  This time in particular, the staff was fervently apologizing to the table next to us for something also!  We don't know the particulars but we weren't terribly surprised either, as we prepare ourselves.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example of the level of service that happens here EVERY time we've come.  The food here is truly outstanding, both cooked in back & from the sushi bar..  We LOVE it.  It's unique, creative, delicious.  Your Cedar Plank Salmon on the forbidden rice is my favorite salmon dish in the city.  (once served to me raw/cold in the middle)
 
But dealing with the level of service has become a real chore.

Previous visit:  Server delivered wife's entree- held it up in the air- 1 inch from her face until she took it from the server's hands.  in retrospect, my wife thinks the fella might be special needs, so she forgave it.  But please, just set the plate down on the table.
Previous visit: Delivered me the wrong order.  Made my correct order which, again, staggered my wife eating her plate then I'm eating mine.
Different visit: Delivered us another table's order.
Our second visit there: Had no waitress.  20 minutes in, actually had someone come to our table and apologize for no service, and hostess came to help and take our drink order.

We LOVE your food.  We love the design, and the feel of the place.  The music is relaxed but upbeat at the same time- perfect choices. We love how you try so hard to make up for your errors.  The people are so nice.  But like a relationship partner that just keeps falling short-  we leave feeling a little disappointed- every time.

Pizza seems like the only choice, so it was so great to find a real restaurant by such a great chef open late to serve hungry people. We attended a concert on a Monday and we didn't get out until very late and were needed to eat some food. This place did not disappoint. We got seated right away and our waiter was amazing. He was incredibly on point with the menu and able to answer any questions from our group. My husband and I shared a salad and a burger. I told the waiter that  we were sharing and they evenly split both items, which was really great. The Cesar salad was simple but the dressing was amazing and evenly coated the lettuce. It came with cherry tomatoes and unlike most restaurants that serve things that look like tomatoes but never actually tastes like them, these were amazing, they were sweet and actually tasted like a real tomato. The burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. It came with fries too which were great.Three of us all got  the same burger. One friend got a pepperoni pizza and was very pleased and someone got the crab cakes. Once the food arrived no one spoke, everyone amerced themselves in eating and everyone was incredibly pleased. there were several cocktails - two moscow mules and I had an amazing cocktail here is was a lima sour I believe and it was plum/lime inspired.

8,8,4.0,"notes: 1 visit, breakfast/lunch
overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.

highlights: 
- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.
- Prime rib is excellent
- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.
- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

Avoid:
- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.
- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.",2010-01-08 04:28:23
173,442,4.0,"Was in town town for a concert and have friends that live here and we're raving about baguette cafe. I was so excited I started reading the menu on the plane so I knew I was going to try  the raisin pastry (sorry don't know the French name for it). It was perfectly crispy flaky on the outside with just a touch of custard running through curves. So good that I want one right now. We also tried the plain croissant and apricot croissant. I would definitely order the plain croissant. But I would pass on the apricot - it wasn't bad, but not nearly as good as the the other two. We ordered the quiche with pancetta. The flavor and the crust were amazing the only thing that held me back from a 5 star was the texture. It was so creamy (do they use cream cheese?)that at first I thought it was undercooked. It was still good - just was a little odd - but change is good right? The owners are from France and are the nicest!

How the heck do I get here on the elevator like some of the others? Urgh. If i could sprout wings, I definitely would. This place is like a destination location.

Every single time I have come here I am introduced to a new set of stairs. As much as I want to OOoo and Ahhh about how wondrous this place is, I'll have to say it's okay. On the initial visit, I lost the bachelorette party I came with and had to do the whole ""I'm next to a pool. You are too? I don't see you! Oh you're by the OTHER pool"" bit.  Suffice to say, it took awhile to reunite. This place is huge. 

The last time I was here was this past St. Patrick's Day when Kaskade performed. Amen to getting tickets in advance!! BF, friends, and myself all walked in without a hitch. The dance floor filled up rather quickly. People claiming to be Kaskade's brother's friends' barber from another mother fist pumped and jumped on my toes. Yeah, no thanks. We got in at 9pm and waited until Kaskade's set four hours later. The first resident DJ was ok. The dj after him was pretty bad. Come 1am, the entire vibe inside the room changed and it was completely enthralling. The moment Kaskade stepped onto the stage it was party time.  

People were fist pumping/ shoving/ throwing drinks on one another. Little people were getting trampled. It was chaos. 

It wasn't until almost 3am when security started getting involved with moving the crowd along the floor. Thank God and thank you Kaskade for making that night one of the best experiences I've had in Vegas.",2012-03-30 04:11:09

302,116,4.0,"I'm not going to get into the different flavors and what I liked and didn't, because taste is sooooo subjective. I'll just say that I'm willing to bet that everyone will find lots of things that they like and a few that they don't. Good news: there's a tasting bar where you can find out what works for you and what doesn't. (be warned - there's a huge difference between a single sip of these bad boys and drinking a pint. More on that in a minute.)

In-store experience was fantastic. Answered all my questions, great attitude, smiles all around. I wanted to do a 3-day cleanse so I purchased one each of the virgin, amateur, and pro packages. You can also make your own, but I'm a noob. The main difference is that as you move up the scale towards 'pro', you get less fruit, less calories, and more veggies.

Over the three days I lost 5 lbs. (individual results may vary, check local listings for show times) This is likely due to the fact that I had deviated from my usual diet of IPA, wine, whatever the eff I want to eat that sounds good at the moment, and IPA. I was in the bathroom a lot on day one. A LOT. No, A LOT. Day two, hungry. Hangry. Day 3, inexplicably, was a breeze. High energy, never hungry. So weird. It's day 3 that made me a fan of the 'juice cleanse'. But the best day of a 3-day cleanse is, hands down, day 4. Would I do it again? Yes. Right after I finish this bacon sandwich.

All of the nut milk drinks were delicious. Some have more sugar than others, so be careful there. The 'Clay Mate' that they end each day with is by turns tasty, strange, and by the end, difficult to finish. But maybe I don't typically drink as much clay as you do. I do liken the experience to going wine tasting, where everything is delicious in the tasting room and maybe a little underwhelming after you've had the whole bottle back at home.

I dig this place, except for the packaging on the bottles. Labels are attractive, of course, but I have two other issues. #1: the caps on the bottles are virtually impossible to separate from the little plastic ring that's supposed to stay on the bottle. The whole thing comes off (16 out of 18 times in my case). #2, and more important: these guys NEED to recycle. Seriously. I'm sitting here staring at 20 empty glass bottles - and thick, heavy glass at that - on my counter. It seems to me that the right thing to do would be to offer some type of bottle exchange program where you get a small discount on your next purchase (or points in the loyalty program they offer) when you bring your bottles back. An easy way to get folks back in the store that might otherwise not be, by the way. PFJ, when you read this... please. Recycle. It's what any self-respecting hippie juice bar would do.",2015-08-29 21:44:12
847,409,1.0,"I have gone to Cherry Lash for 2 years now. The first year, my service was amazing. I would easily book an appointment online or with the front staff. However, over the past year, something has definitely changed. I always book my appointments at least 3 weeks in advance, and since October 9, 2013, have been cancelled and rescheduled only after being on hold for 10 or minutes or asking to speak with a manager. Not only that, the lashes used to last me at least a month, and now they are almost all off after 2 weeks (This is with me getting a Fill-PLUS every 3 weeks).

I recently asked to speak with the district manager, Ivonne, and after doing so was in tears. She was extremely condescending, and did nothing to help the situation after being cancelled on for the 9th time, because she said it was only the 4th. I have my account records showing it was 9, even though she continued to tell me she didn't see it. I know the prices are alluring, but the customer service is not worth it!!!

We ordered their sesame bombe, since it looked very unique and very tasty, based on the amount of Yelp photos it had. We both liked black sesame, so we gave it a try, and we didn't regret trying it at all. It was very light and fluffy, with the drizzle of black sesame just coating the dessert ever so perfectly. I think that it settled in my stomach quite well, and I felt very satisfied with the dessert afterwards. It definitely satisfied my craving for something sweet - it was just the right amount of sweetness, to be honest with you, and not overpowering at all.

To me, the sesame bombe is one of the dishes that makes this place stand out from the rest at the Strip. For a price of $12, the portion size could have been a bit bigger, but hey, you're in Vegas, so you pay for both the dessert and ambiance. Not to mention that it's located in a popular hotel too (The Venetian)!",2017-03-15 02:12:43

Maybe because I've been going to this Casino for at least four years, I've seen a decline in the upkeep.  I'm disappointed to see wear in the furniture and that the casino has started to smell smokey.  Initially when visiting this casino I appreciated that it did not smell smokey, but upon a recent trip to the movies, just walking in off the elevator from the garage there was a smokey smell through the casino :-(

891,461,5.0,"Before last week, my boyfriend and I had never been to Las Vegas, so I decided to do a little research of local restaurants that served seafood that were NOT buffets. We are both big crab and lobster buffs, and I wanted to find hot, fresh crab legs that hadn't been sitting in ice while lines of people annhilated them like they'd never seen food before. I came across reviews of this little ""hole in the wall"" establishment and wrote down the address. If you have a rental car, or are visiting someone with a car, it's perfect. However, a cab ride from a hotel on the strip will cost you 25 bucks to get there; a tad steep, but I think it was definitely worth every penny. 

We came there for one reason and one reason only: all you can eat crab legs. I can't say anything about their catfish or the salad bar, but after looking over the menu for the heck of it, they do have a large selection of seemingly authentic southern dishes; gator bites, fried oysters, etc. Also, the service is extremely friendly and very efficient; our waitress wouldnt let our crab plate get empty or the bucket for the shells too full, but she would always ask if were ready for another plate full so they wouldn't get cold. Even with tables everywhere, she never seemed flustered and made small talk with every table. 

The crab legs themselves were delicious; really large legs and claws and none of them short of meat. We also tried the Rio seafood buffet and the crab legs at the Hush Puppy were 10x better. A buffet is too scrambled with people fighting over crab legs, so to get them served to you whenever you want and as much as you want while theyre piping hot is a wonderful treat. The only downside, like previously mentioned, is how far it is from the strip. But, after eating what was quite possibly 10 pounds each, my boyfriend and I left full, satisfied, and extremely pleased with everything the Hush Puppy had to offer. If you do plan a trip to Vegas, make sure there is a Monday on your vacation!",2010-05-21 20:43:47

We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can't think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It's possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I'm already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge.

I would definitely recommend one of their margaritas it was very nice very well put together not too much alcohol and not too much sugar and cocktail mix it was great.

Pepperoni Pizza: Very good. Thin crust just as I like it. The largest pizza was 10 slices and worked out perfect for 4 of us.

Ceasar Salad: Very good. We asked and were told it would probably serve 4 of us but we ended up needing to order another one and finished that off too.
 
Zeppoli: Amazing - these were delicious. Hot, airy little fried pillows of dough with a delicious Raspberry Sauce to dip them in.

Everyone else's food came out fine, but my omelette was cold and the cheese inside was 2 pieces of two stale, unmelted pieces of Swiss and American. I showed the waitress the omelette and she just stared me in the face silently as if this kind of food was acceptable to eat. I asked her to take it back and she did. No apologies, no offer to remake it or to replace it with something else. The manager didn't even emerge to apologize. I wasn't expecting a free check, but an acknowledgement of wrong doing would've been the correct thing to do. Sadly, this is the second chance I've given this location.

The sauce for the spaghetti was so rich and flavorful and although I didn't try their selections my sister claimed it was the best lasagna she's ever tried. It is a little pricey but it's so worth it for the quality of the food and the great service. A must try if you're in Vegas!",2013-12-29 00:00:24
216,152,4.0,"I'm actually giving this place 3.5 stars.

The place is really good for sushi. We got the lunch special which is order an appetizer or nigiri and then 2 rolls for $9.99.  Me and my brother order 4 rolls and 3 out of those 4 were really good...the last one (the triple ocean...I think it was called)...the sauce was overpowering. 

One thing was bothering me was that I got my one order roll...and then got my appetizer....and then my 2nd roll. This was fine but the appetizer should be the first item out...that is why it is called an appetizer. (I do have to say that the gyoza appetizer was lacking seasoning...I mostly was tasting green onions...and that's it)  Like it said it didn't bother me that much because all of our food came out in a quickly matter.

However, the main problem of this restaurant is the decor and layout.  When you walk in...you are greeted by a wall and makes the entrance cramped and unwelcoming.  If they knocked down that wall...it will make the restaurant more 'open' and inviting.  Plus the decor is tacky and the paint seems to fade a little bit.  The ceilings tiles should be clean a little bit.

Overall, the food is good. Service good. Decor...need improving. 

Will I come back again? Most likely.",2015-01-21 23:36:03

sushi was good but not even close to the best i've had which i'll be reviewing soon.

And waited.  There was a table of 6 next to us and I was amazed how their order was delivered one burger at a time, about 5 minutes apart.  And we waited.  It took 33 minutes to get 2 regular burgers and 2 drinks. Not even offered our drinks while we waited, no updates on the status of our order.  There were 7 people working around the grill... it was crazy.  I could have gotten a better burger at Red Robin or other restaurants in half the time.  Really too bad, we could use a good cafe on the west side.  

Pros:  Good location
            Staff was reasonably friendly
            Prices were not out of line
            Sizable menu (in fact, probably too large or ambitious)

Cons: Amazingly disorganized kitchen
            No Coke or Dr. Pepper. I was amazed now many people in line  
            asked for both, but got neither.

Walking to this display, you get to experience the boulevard as well - real fun going into other casinos and observing.
The schedule is about 15-20 minutes per display, so be ready for the crowds. The street level is one of the best spots, if you get a spot near the waters. I recommend the Bellagio stairs for the view, bit of a distance on the side but a good view. Love the extra boom from the splash of the waters falling back onto the pond at the end, pretty neat.

Highly understaffed and rude to boot.

First off all you'd have to be drunk to enjoy the awful food and since we are having trouble even ordering a drink it's just a miserable experience. 

I won't ever be returning to El Hefe for any reason. Even if they were giving away Tequila for free, I'd find another spot to drink. 

Clearly they make lots of money and the management doesn't care for their customers.

1113,181,1.0,"This dump does not even deserve 1 star! I was looking forward to my second visit to Chipotle in my life and it happened to appear like a message from God after a long walk on the strip. The workers on the ""burrito"" line were great...except for the last two. One girl wrapped up your burrito in foil and the other wrote on them and prepared them for the cashier. The girl wrapping the burritos seemed like a robot and therefore didn't notice that every piece of pre-cut foil was a little too small to wrap the full burrito. This left a small 1/2 inch by 2 inch exposed area on the burrito. That's OK (I thought) as she finished wrapping, but then the retard flipped the burritio upside down and the next employee in line just slid the burrito down the counter to the cashier! SOOOO GROSS. You could tell they had a ""rhythm"" going as it was busy (as I'm sure it always is since it's on the strip). So once I told her there was no way in hell i was eating a burrito that had been slid on a counter all the way to the cashier, she seemed upset but ordered another burrito to be made right away. Then, I get to the cashier and order myself a Corona with my burrito. Corona pops on the counter but with a disgusting lime. It wasn't even a faint shade of green, it was brown and way squishy. Almost the consistency of playdoh. I'm not about to drink herpes in a bottle so I explained that the lime was near compost quality and the same lady that I complained about the burrito to went fishing in the lime bin. She came out with another lime that had a brown bruise on the skin and said ""They all look like that"" and I took it, because I am well aware of the bruising habits of limes in particular since Coronas are like water in my life. I could have debated on the difference between the first lime I received and the second, but I was hungry and really needed to start chugging the beer after my experience. Sorry for the INCONVENIENCE CHIPOTLE. I surely slowed down your process on that nice Saturday afternoon on the strip but why don't you serve SANITARY food. As far as I'm concerned, you should be shut down for health violations, but I am sure you won't be because most of the people ingesting your food are drunk and/or nasty and probably already have HIV.",2010-11-23 17:09:04

I love the food, truly do, but the service at this location is most certainly 5 points under where it should be. We were taking our friends to dinner to share with them some very important news on a Saturday. We arrived at 6:30 and checked in for a party of 6, was told it'd be a 25 minute wait. At 7:00 I decided to check and see how much longer and was told that my party was already seated. I informed the little hostess that we were not, we were all outside, and she blankly stared at me in disbelief. I asked how much longer and she said probably another 25 minutes. They had my name written down along with what shirt I was wearing and I at no point saw another women with a blue striped tank top arrive with a party of 6 so I demanded to see the manager. Instead of getting the manager she went and got the bartender, who was by no means apologetic for their obvious mistake.

If you're from the south and you have had a Bojangles Cajun Filet Biscuit, that is better than these biscuits.  The fry on the chicken is light, which is nice but it's no seasoned very well. BUT- the mac-n-cheese!!!  So delish!  It's rich, gooey and worth the trip alone.  I highly recommend. 

The portions are a good size. Many people were eating their signature dish of chicken and waffles and watermelon but that does not appeal as so many places have this these days. Plus it's comes with 4 pieces of fried chicken which is way too much.

My mind is blown that EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I go to this location in person, or call in an order ahead, it's always messed up or not there. Always. A one entree order? Botched. A large to go order? Not even sure if it's ours. A large catering order to go? Missing. I guess I'm the real idiot for coming back.

We ordered the spicy tuna, salmon avocado, shrimp tempura and spicy scallop rolls. It then took about 45 mins. to get our rolls and we were starving! We ate those rolls pretty fast once they got to the table. We were still hungry, so for some reason we thought it would be a good idea to get some more rolls. Bad idea. The next set of sushi rolls took another hour. We almost wanted to cancel the order b/c it was taking so long. We were hungry but also tired and just wanted to get out of there. 

After we finally got the second set of sushi rolls, we immediately asked for our bill b/c we knew that would take a while, which we were right about. 

After about another 20 minutes, we were able to pay our bill and leave. 

As far as the sushi goes, it was really good. Our favorite was the shrimp tempura. Our least favorites were the spicy scallop and tuna b/c they were not spicy.

Anyway, we got here after 11PM and were seated. We specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. You mean the 15 seat bar? We don't drink so I declined. Not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... Our mediocre late night snack came to $70....

Should stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go. 

Salt and pepper squid- good. Not overly fried. Lime was nice touch.

Samba strip, salmon avocado and spicy tuna... nothing fancy and have had way better.",2015-07-16 07:10:34
1429,59,5.0,"I felt deliriously comfortable after my southern comfort feast- this place does everything RIGHT! 
And they've got some great flights for Bourbon lovers too!

Our server, Justin, was sweet and polite- like all good southern boys. He did the unthinkable... he actually steered me away from the Mac n Cheese and suggested the Brussels Sprouts. I know... crazy. Thankfully, I went against my gut feeling and decided to trust him and O! M! G! they were amazing!!! They were slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and swimming in warm, spiced honey. 

I didn't think I could be any happier, till my chicken arrived. It was fried but also falling off the bone. I hardly had to chew and I was sad when it was gone.  It wasn't fried to a crisp and the dark meat was juicy and flavorful. We had some dipping sauces that I never got a chance to use because my chicken was gone after a couple of bites.
Oh, did I mention it comes with a side of chilled spiced watermelon?! Yes- they did that. And I loved it! So refreshing and gently sweet. 

We also ordered a pan of cornbread with with a glob of butter slowly melting into it. As we cut into it, we could see pieces of corn inside. Just beautiful.

Something I noticed about this restaurant was that besides our wonderful servers, there was a roving manager who would approach all the tables and ask if everything was ok. I truly felt the Southern Hospitality vibe. We got waves and smiles from everyone on our way in and out.

959,188,3.0,"THEhotel, the sister hotel to Mandalay Bay, was slightly disappointing.  Although I really liked the modern decor and large rooms, there were a few downsides that were quite unpleasant.  First of all, the whole hotel reeked of sulfur, from the lobby to the hallways.  I'm not sure what the cause of that smell was but it was pretty disgusting.  Luckily the smell wasn't in our room!  The rooms are spacious but the beds are not very comfortable.  Even though it was nice that the hotel didn't have a casino, thus no smoke, it would have been convenient to have its own pool.  If you want to go to the pool, its a 10-15 minute walk from the bottom of the elevators.  Overall, it's not the best hotel, and I probably won't be returning.",2013-05-08 00:34:30

However, over the past year, something has definitely changed. I always book my appointments at least 3 weeks in advance, and since October 9, 2013, have been cancelled and rescheduled only after being on hold for 10 or minutes or asking to speak with a manager. Not only that, the lashes used to last me at least a month, and now they are almost all off after 2 weeks (This is with me getting a Fill-PLUS every 3 weeks).

I recently asked to speak with the district manager, Ivonne, and after doing so was in tears. She was extremely condescending, and did nothing to help the situation after being cancelled on for the 9th time, because she said it was only the 4th. I have my account records showing it was 9, even though she continued to tell me she didn't see it. I know the prices are alluring, but the customer service is not worth it!!!

I don't need to eat a large portion. At the top of the menu it states focaccia bread is available ""on request"". In all my past visits I didn't need to ""request"" the delicious focaccia with oil and balsamic. Okay. I can submit my request for bread. But hold on here folks! What I received was what looked and tasted like pizza dough wedges with no sign of oil and balsamic. Enough.

A little heavy on the garlic if that bothers you. It was perfect though for something greasy to help soak up the booze. 

You don't sit down here- you grab a slice, eat at the counter and go. You also don't go here for beverages- there selection is limited. You go here for the pizza and that's it.

Before I lived in Charlotte, my beau would take me here on my visits to the city. The baby blue, lost-in-wonderland theme was charming and I wanted one of everything on the menu. While it's a bit pricey, they also serve french press coffee that is every bit worth the price.

That said, the experience has lost it's luster in my past few visits. Amelie's was becoming well known and deservingly so. Every pastry I've had from them was absolutely divine. Who wouldn't want to come here?

Perhaps I've just come at cosmic peak hours, but the lines had grown to Disneyland proportions in my recent visits. The cashiers started to come down the line to take our orders before we were anywhere near the glass cases to look at our options. How am I supposed to know what I want when I haven't even seen it yet? In both my last visits, they also informed us in the line that it would be 30-45 minutes if we wanted to order a sandwich or anything not pastry. While understandable with the crowd to staff ratio, this was kind of disappointing. 

The inside decor of this place is lovely. Lots of artsy kitchy stuff and cozy couches. However as busy as it was, there was nary a seat in the place. My last couple visits involved devouring a pastry in the enclosed strip mall alley behind the building. Because I've lost hope of enjoying the experience of this place, I no longer go to Amelies. Which is a shame because they have some damned good pastries on their menu.",2014-12-16 21:01:27

Our first server who was a tall brunette, she was awesome. Then a blonde came to get our order, she was very rude when i asked for no mushrooms on my strip. ""Is that a allergy or just some preference?"" excuse the hell out of me? I worked in the restaurant business and never asked my customer that. You should simply agree and smile. She then gave my boyfriend the same attitude....
Our food came, it was pretty good. I was cutting my steak with the butter knife provided, she then came and pretty much slammed down a steak knife and said ""Here is a steak knife"" and proceeded to storm off. 
We watched her with other customers and she seemed fine with the one paying big bucks for appetizers and drinks, sorry that we were on a budget for new years.

The first time I visited Gold and Silver, Pawn Stars was relatively new and we thought it would be fun to check it out. It was like a typical Pawn Shop save for a few ""Pawn Stars"" t-shirts.

The second time I visited Gold and Silver, Pawn Stars was becoming extremely popular. The place was going through a renovation and my mother and I brought in some scrap metals to sell at market price. The man we met with was kind and courteous and even gave us a signed photo of Rick Harrison and The Old Man. Overall it was a pleasant experience.

On out last trip however we decided to visit the shop again since the show is now the #1 show on cable. What we encountered was an extremely rude staff and absolutely no courtesy as potential buyers. The man behind the counter was extremely rude to my mother and in my book, that's not acceptable.

408,241,1.0,"I hope to bring awareness to our unfortunate experience at Futo Buta to prevent another disabled persons from having to be treated like we were.  We were treated with outright mean spirit and disrespect by our server, Abbey, who did not understand that a disabled guest could not sit on one of the restaurants high tables or on a barstool.

We arrived shortly after opening at 11 am and the hostess graciously sat me and my disabled lunch buddy at one of the tables with chairs and not the tall barstools. The physical limitations of the person I was with inhibit them from being able to sit on a barstool or at a high table.  The server, much to our surprise, started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush. After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly!), the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy.  

It is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved.  We were the first customers of the day.  At this point, there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar. We were not in anyone's way and were not blocking anyone or thing.  We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would.  We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason, but the server did not have one.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch.  

We have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect.  I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities, or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so.  If you do have plan, you should make sure your staff is aware of it.  Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation.

- we dedicated the ""only meal of the day"" for a buffet lunch
- the first buffet we went to (which was located in another hotel, I forget which and its name) turned us down because we had several guys in our group who didn't have sleeved shirts on upon entrance

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE/INSIDE):
- hard to miss an open space that has nothing but food
- looks somewhat like a food court

THE WAY IT WORKS:
- go in from the entrance, where the cash registers are
- pay for your meal and indicate how many are in your party
- you are then assigned seating according to how big your party is
- unlimited beer and wine go along with your buffet meal

WHAT THEY HAVE:
- desserts
- cold items (i.e. meats and cheeses like when you drink wine; salad area)
- Asian
- Latino
- American
- Carving
- Italian
- bar
- Seafood

WHAT WE HAD:
- a little bit of everything
- the Latino portion was just sad and not authentic at all
- the Asian portion was fairly decent
- the cold items portion was only good from the meats and cheeses; the salads didn't look fresh
- the desserts were just ok
- the carving and seafood stations were on point! (I wouldn't know about the seafood personally, but a lot of the people in my group kept going back to that station)
- some of the things in the Italian section were selectively better than others (i.e. pasta)

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- the register people aren't pleasant
- the seating attendants are VERY welcoming
- the bartender worked fairly slow and had a hard time remembering our 2 drinks we ordered",2015-07-15 20:25:10

Yardbird's specialty is their fried chicken. The kind waitress explained how the chicken is brined for 25 hours and flash fried in 3 minutes - quite impressive numbers! I guess bottom line: you get what you paid for. Chicken was delicious and moist on the inside, but for $26 for 4 pieces of chicken, I highly doubt I'll return for seconds. That's $7 for each piece!

The service has varied from decent to bad, and yes,  if you ask to split the check they automatically add a couple extra bucks to your bill without telling you. A little deceiving, if you ask me, but the reason I keep going back is because their prices are great and (some of) thier food is pretty good for a Japanese restaurant in Arizona.

204,59,5.0,"My friend and I ate here for dinner after our full day on the Strip having fun. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, since there was almost a full house that night. The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.

The crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!

The Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!

My friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!",2017-03-15 02:28:50

Today we went for breakfast, no complaints, no issues, just wanted to get some food.

The food is delicious but not too heavy... I left satiated and not feeling like I would explode (like I do at a lot of restaurants here... not that I'm complaining!)

My friend and I showed up around noon without reservations and were seated promptly on the terrace.  It was so beautifully decorated, you almost felt like you were in a little taverna in Greece and not on the The Strip.  The service was very attentive yet not intrusive.  For the appetizer, I had the Greek Meze Plate which had a selection of tzatziki, some sort of hummus-type spread, and a red-pepper spread with pita triangles, olives, and cheese.  Absolutely perfect in every way.  My friend had the tomato and feta salad which she enjoyed as well.  We both had the shrimp dish which was served with tomato sauce and feta with cous cous.  Loved this as well.  For dessert my friend had the fresh fruit plate (which honestly looked a little disappointing but that's just me) and I had the yogurt martini which was the smoothest greek yogurt I've ever had with a berry sauce on top.  Perfect end to the meal.

Honestly, this was one of the best meals I had on the Las Vegas strip and one of the most delicious.  I will DEFINITELY come back to eat here again... in fact I'm thinking about going there again for lunch tomorrow!  Yes, it was that awesome!",2012-12-04 21:12:12

The room itself was dated but clean. There were some stains on the sofa and carpet but we made a path with towels and kept our socks on at all times. 

The kicker at this place is that they charge a $28 ""resort fee"". They don't offer anything for it. There is no coffee in the rooms, you must purchase a small cup for $9. Room wasn't serviced over a two day period. I have paid resort fees before and they include something, to include local calls is a little ridiculous considering that most if not all people have a cell phone. Speaking of which there was limited reception. 

I can't say I would stay here again. However the customer service and check in went smoothly and all staff were very nice. 

This hotel or ""resort"" is not worth more than $40 on the weekends including the resort fee.

The room was clean and spacious; We had a king suite. Free coffee is nice but it's in the lobby only. And there are advertised ice machines on the 5th floor that are not there so you have to search. 

The people staying in this hotel were rude, gross and complained every time we were in the lobby. We didn't even go to the pool happy hour because of the crowd it attracted. I guess the lower prices attract a lower class. We wanted to stay downtown one time for the experience and we go it!  It's not entirely the hotels fault. I will never stay here again though. Downtown is ridiculous now.",2016-08-23 15:34:17
1215,91,5.0,"After somehow agreeing to trek halfway across Montreal to eat lunch at a Vegan restaurant (still in food coma from Liverpool House the night before, see review)  I came to my senses and realized I needed real coffee and dessert made with things like cream or butter. 

 Found this spot thanks to a large number of positive Yelp Reviews.  Turns out they don't take CC but were happy to take our American Dollars.

We ordered three completely different items an all were still warm (it was about 2:30 pm) and delicious - not even a crumb made it out of this boulangerie unless it was in our stomachs.   Coffee also excellent.

Visited El Hefe this past weekend and had a great experience. Service was top notch, food came out quickly, and the drinks certainly were the highlights. 

If you noticed my prior review, I am pleased to share the entire staff, management, and everyone we encountered was polite, friendly, and very accommodating. 

Jessica served us and she was a delight! Very attentive and made our experience really sweet. 

Guys-- the eye candy at El Hefe is reason enough to go... And if you're planning on bringing your lady, just keep your eyes glued on your date so you don't get in trouble drooling... Because this place may be one of the best places to watch any game, fight, or match on their huge and many TVs. 

The selection of tequila & beer should meet any preferences or demands. We drank Casa Noble and had a delish margarita. Very good!!! 

The food is a big step up from typical bar food, but don't expect authentic Mexican cuisine. They offer a great selection of tacos and snacks to pair your appetite for drinks. We loved the macho nachos and there's no way 2 people can eat all those chips piled high with all that yummy cheesy goodness. For a sun night out or to watch any exciting game, you will enjoy the snacks and the killer drink selection. 

Coming back a second time, I made sure to seek out the management crew and shared my thoughts about my experiences. My biggest advice is seek out Rob, Erik, or Jamie if anything is either really good or really bad-- these guys truly care about the customer experience, and are striving to make El Hefe remarkable. 

While I had my doubts, I am a fan and will be back during my visits to AZ!

However, over the past year, something has definitely changed. I always book my appointments at least 3 weeks in advance, and since October 9, 2013, have been cancelled and rescheduled only after being on hold for 10 or minutes or asking to speak with a manager. Not only that, the lashes used to last me at least a month, and now they are almost all off after 2 weeks (This is with me getting a Fill-PLUS every 3 weeks).

I recently asked to speak with the district manager, Ivonne, and after doing so was in tears. She was extremely condescending, and did nothing to help the situation after being cancelled on for the 9th time, because she said it was only the 4th. I have my account records showing it was 9, even though she continued to tell me she didn't see it. I know the prices are alluring, but the customer service is not worth it!!!

891,461,5.0,"Before last week, my boyfriend and I had never been to Las Vegas, so I decided to do a little research of local restaurants that served seafood that were NOT buffets. We are both big crab and lobster buffs, and I wanted to find hot, fresh crab legs that hadn't been sitting in ice while lines of people annhilated them like they'd never seen food before. I came across reviews of this little ""hole in the wall"" establishment and wrote down the address. If you have a rental car, or are visiting someone with a car, it's perfect. However, a cab ride from a hotel on the strip will cost you 25 bucks to get there; a tad steep, but I think it was definitely worth every penny. 

We came there for one reason and one reason only: all you can eat crab legs. I can't say anything about their catfish or the salad bar, but after looking over the menu for the heck of it, they do have a large selection of seemingly authentic southern dishes; gator bites, fried oysters, etc. Also, the service is extremely friendly and very efficient; our waitress wouldnt let our crab plate get empty or the bucket for the shells too full, but she would always ask if were ready for another plate full so they wouldn't get cold. Even with tables everywhere, she never seemed flustered and made small talk with every table. 

The crab legs themselves were delicious; really large legs and claws and none of them short of meat. We also tried the Rio seafood buffet and the crab legs at the Hush Puppy were 10x better. A buffet is too scrambled with people fighting over crab legs, so to get them served to you whenever you want and as much as you want while theyre piping hot is a wonderful treat. The only downside, like previously mentioned, is how far it is from the strip. But, after eating what was quite possibly 10 pounds each, my boyfriend and I left full, satisfied, and extremely pleased with everything the Hush Puppy had to offer. If you do plan a trip to Vegas, make sure there is a Monday on your vacation!",2010-05-21 20:43:47

I found the menu to be a bit underwhelming. My friend and I ordered the polenta fries, warm Brie with poached pear, a french onion soup, and a veggie burger- all to share. The polenta fries were tasteless and not at all appetizing. The French onion soup was decent (not the best I've had but not the worst either), the veggie burger was just okay (also kind of bland), but the warm Brie with poached pear was phenomenal and the best part of our meal! 

If it wasn't for the warm Brie then I would say our meal would have been a total bust, but luckily the warm Brie dish redeemed our entire culinary experience at this place. The guy sitting next to me ordered the fish and chips and it looked good, but I would probably not be back.

My chicken burrito was great for it was only $3
I love how they have daily specials for weekdays, it's just awesome when you are trying to save some bucks and still get the great taste and portion

the only downside why I didn't give it a 5-star is due to the kitchen size, the food may take awhile when it gets busy. And I noticed that's why many people call ahead to place the order before they go pick it up

Both times I have been we had 5 girls in a room and it did not feel cramped.  The extra bathroom and sitting area is great for a large group.  

The bathrooms are very large and updated.  The beds are incredibly comfortable (although any bed after a night at the Vegas clubs is probably comfortable).  It is on the strip, but at one end.  There aren't too many places within walking distance.

They do have a liquor store across the street that you can walk to.  I also highly recommend Evening Call, the little bar right as you enter the casino floor.  They have great alcoholic slushy drinks that are great while sitting by the pool.  Speaking of the pools that is another aspect of THEhotel that I love.  They have a large wave pool that is always filled with kids and families.  It is great if you like wave pools.  They also have a lazy river that is fun for all ages.  There are a few smaller pools that cater more to the adult crowd.  Then there is also the ""toptional"" pool that I don't remember the name of.  They have great music and it is definitely adults only.  There is a cover to get into this pool which for guys is quite steep but it is a lot of fun.

436,544,4.0,"I don't know why this place gets a bad rap, I was totally pleased with my stay here (though the dumb resort fee pisses me off no matter what). We stayed at the end of january for monday-friday. It must have been a slow time because we waited for only a few minutes to check in & had no problems. Ours was a standard room in tower 1 (the old tower i guess), but the room was clean & nice, not stinky. Not fancy, but good enough for me. If someone is a snoot and going to complain about chips on the door or rattling bathroom fan, then sure they'll hate this place, but if you are a normal person who lives with minor imperfections on a daily basis, you'll be just fine. We were on the 20th floor and the wifi worked just fine. I even brought my laptop & ethernet cord in preparation for having no wifi based on others' reviews, but was pleasantly surprised.(atleast that resort fee was for something i guess). We did a late check out option for $28 meaning we could wait to check out until 3pm. Very useful. I actually like the cheesy ""outdated"" casino, I find it cozier and more homey than the huge richy rich pretentious places. The foodcourt & walkways between the excaliber & neighboring casinos(luxor &NYNY) were really nifty and had good(though conspicuously overpriced) food options if you just need to grab something quick. The ""fun dungeon"" is a cute little arcade downstairs that is a fun diversion from the adult activities, it's only open til 10pm or so though.  I would totally stay here again and actually preferred it over the Luxor which we stayed at last year, though the luxor's room was just a teensy bit nicer.",2015-02-02 10:33:51

I have never ever been to any Indian Restaurant and came out so full. Have been to several la-crate in evening and tried lunch buffet today. Every dish was awsome tasty, including Samosa, Gulab jamun, mango custard, Raita, Kheer, DIY Papdi chaat.

Usually an Indian restaurant has few star dishes and few OK dishes, but here we tasted every dish and liked it. Surprisingly it is priced lower than other restarunt, may be due to not-so-great ambiance.

They prepare fresh Jalebi every evening, but I have enjoyed great taste even after a week in home fridge (Just microwave it for 10-12 seconds). There are several Indian sweets on sale too.

Service is a bit slow (or careless) so remind to refill your breads (freshly cooked). You get wheat naan here as part of buffet (a rare feat). You cna't go wrong with this place. Weekend Buffet 8.99 & Kid buffet is $4.99. Looks like week day buffets is cheaper.

They have a huge variety of drinks (with a full bar), mostly centered around margaritas; it is, afterall, in their name. If you want their strongest drink, get the Perfect Margarita (gold tequila, silver tequila, triple sec, orange curacao and lime juice on the rocks. I can't say it tasted very good because, well, it didn't; but it did its job.

I may have been drunk after an additional shot of grey goose, but I'm calling BS on this extra tax they charged us. The sales tax in Vegas is 8.1%, but they charged us 18.1%. I knew something wasn't right when the tax they charged was higher than the amount listed next to the suggested 15% tip amount. When I asked our server about it, he said all places in Vegas charge an extra 10% tax at places where they have entertainment. That's the first time I've ever heard about something like that.

And I can't say that lightly as we love brunch and have been to some of the top places in the top cities for brunch.

Basically the deal here is you play a flat amount (like $40) and they serve unlimited small plates. Options range from Benedicts to Chilaquiles to Chicken and Waffles to Shrimp and Grits. I will be real in that I tried almost everything and loved everything I tried! 

The big standouts were the Chicken and Waffles, Steak and Eggs, and Chilaquiles. They also gave us a guava empanada which was not on the menu but was awesome! 

My pro tip: when ordering don't have everyone get the same thing. Mix and match and share! Otherwise you will fill up fast! 

Other pro tip: make a reservation. We got there at 11am which was a tad early for brunch there but by 1pm it was packed in there!",2018-01-21 17:52:25
15,14,2.0,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2017-01-02 03:48:03

Prices are decent especially for Vegas and the food is delicious.  I have never had something I didn't like.  My favorite was the brunch tapas menu.  For a set price (I think it was $20 for brunch plus $5 for mimosas) you get unlimited tapas and mimosas.  The tapas menu had about 20 items on it and everyone I had was amazing.  I was so full I had to stop.  The plantain empanada, mini burito, and Machaca Chilaquiles were particularly amazing.  My mouth is watering thinking about them.  

The service was also amazing.  We had a group of 10 and it was very fast even with the large group.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating.

1660,470,2.0,"I called to make a 3:00pm reservation for a Saturday , the young lady said they didn't have anything until 9:00pm! My husband got on a booking app & booked us an appointment at 3:00pm right away. We walked up to the door at exactly 3:01 & the door was locked. Another couple was sitting outside & said it was closed & they were waiting to get in also. At 3:05 we checked the door again & it was unlocked but no one came outside to tell us they had unlocked the door! (Weird...they saw us trying the door handle). The man who sat us at our table  argued with us about how they were booked!

To our waiters credit he was good but he was the only one running around & since they were ""booked"" until 9pm I would think they would have others waiters? After a long 2 hours the place NEVER filled up! There were probably 150 empty seats!! So I'm not sure why they made such a big deal out of them being booked up?!! 

The food was good but over priced for what you got. The scallops were good but the price comes out to about $10 a piece. The chopped salad everyone made a big deal of was not that big in portion. It was good but for $14 I'll pass.

I ordered a vodka/tonic & it was as flat as a pancake!

We didn't care for the atmosphere as it smells like an old moldy building.

305,345,4.0,"Well for us travelling from Asia, seeing a place like Panda Express is a bliss :) .. not that I do not enjoy the American food, I think it is absolutely lovely, but due to our perpetual love for spices and curries and chili .. the propensity to find that one place, during a long stay, goes on an exponential increase.

So, when you stroll across Panda Express, the hidden senses would wake up and wpuld unconditionally take your steps in there. Then, upon realizing the varieties of wok curries in there .. you would probably start calculating as how many times would you need to visit to finish those all up :D

Now, people might argue that they have eaten better food at such places and all but given this is a type of makeshift fast food Panda Express is quite impressive.

The wok tossed curries which aren't sweetish are absolutely lovely .. like firecracker chicken, chicken with string beans, broccoli beef, asparagus and meat and a few others.

We were 3 people .. went here twice thus were able to master more than a few dishes :) ..

Took a plate with 2 mains .. once .. covering most of the stuffs and loved them all. Probably the least favourite was the teriyaki chicken, it was a bit dry the first time but absolutely lovely the next.

And with their prices and occasional coupons (if you are charming enough to let them give you :P) the place is pure gold :) ..

And it is lovely to see how efficient the staff is .. I mean the girl behind the counter would serve for you .. take your bills .. if she is free would clean up the place .. mop the few things people carelessly throw around .. and what not..

I couldn't understand what happened to the big portion, enough for 2 days and 2 people size lasagna everyone is raving about. I guess Slater thought we wouldn't notice and didn't I tell him we were hungry? (See photo) the description was meat lasagna with meat sauce and there was noting of the sort. I think there was ground sausage and mostly bread crumbs the meat sauce was straight up marinara. As a matter of fact, I thought he brought as the veggie lasagna and verified with Slater that it was in fact their ""Meat"" lasagna. I think they also forgot the lasagna noodles and tried to cover it up with a huge slice of mozzarella that encased the entire 2 inch by 2 inch piece of Lasagna. The deficient piece of lasagna looked more like a large one side ravioli with a huge piece of government cheese on top. The sausage & peppers sandwich was an assemble of 2 pieces of crunchy peppers ( 1 piece red & 1 piece green at one end of the sandwich and caramelized cold onions at the other end. They didn't even bother to throw the 2 in a pan to hear and combine then with the marinara sauce before putting them in the roll. The marinara sauce on the side? Nothing on the bread roll and barely toasted. Did I say I was on a diet?  Atmosphere is clean and fresh smelling.

Flash forward a few months and my thick, ethnic, wavy (just plain difficult) hair grew back enough to be ready for a fix. Sure enough, Michaela worked her magic. The layers are blended and virtually disappear into one another rather than remaining like a tiered cake.

Yes, their prices are a bit higher than other salons, but you get what you pay for. What is a few extra dollars spread out over a few months? I'll skip a Starbucks or two to have my hair looking nice every day for months!!!

ONLY other drawback is limited parking.

I echo many other reviews; owner Kandi (sp?) and Jenny are amazing with cut and color in every circumstance. Both perfectionists and always speaking the truth; if they don't think your hair is the type that will hold that color or be right for that cut, they'll tell you!

Slot machines in the boarding areas make these areas cramped and hard to navigate. The only place to recharge your electronics are few and far between, located in the walkways far from the gates.

35,33,5.0,"A wonderful dinner experience! Hubby and I came couple months ago, it was our first time at Sushi Samba. We didn't have reservations, but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar. 
We had the A5 Wagyu gyoza, was tender and not overdone, Tuna tataki, Chicken Samba was a good size portion, El topo roll, chef sashimi selections, and Tonkotsu ramen. Everything we order was super yummy!  Definitely coming back again next time we're in town!!
I would recommend making reservations next time, the sushi bar is kind of tight and if you order a good amount of food, not too much room.",2017-09-08 23:17:03

1130,18,2.0,"Very disappointed in this place. First off, I waited exactly 3 minutes  and 23 seconds before I was acknowledged (and  yes, I timed it) For a place that seems pretty prideful in food options online, the 'cook' didn't seem terribly concerned or knowledgable in what was in the featured item of the day. (Jack fruit tacos) I asked what all went in it before I ordered she literally shrugged at me and looked up at the menu for clues. The girl who rang me up mentioned to her 'we you should know since you're gonna be making it if she orders it.'

Another disappointment, I wanted to order a raw juice, I asked if it was possible to get just carrot and ginger, she said 'they're premade cause if you've owned a juicer, you'd know they're a bitch to clean.' ...I'm okay, so you're not willing to make something I can have just because the equipment is a hassle for you to clean?

Moving on, since I couldn't have anything else, I opted for lemonade...tastes like watered down minute maid...the jackfruit tacos we're okay,...but left me hungry again an hour later...for $11.95...I'd hoped to be full a little longer..

Overall, for being 'vegan friendly' ...allergens don't seem to be a priority here...gluten free options seemed to be next to nothing which was a bit of a let down. Perhaps I had higher expectations from seeing such high reviews on this place, but I don't think I'll be returning to a place where the workers make you feel like you're an inconvenience to serve.",2017-07-20 21:03:14

1008,429,5.0,"This is my favorite pizzeria of all time.  We have been coming here since 2007, but I'm just now getting around to reviewing it as I'm eating a leftover slice of roasted corn pizza at my desk right now.

Everything is delicious, but the roasted corn & rocket man are my truest loves.  The roasted corn is perfectly balanced & would be the pizza I would choose as my last meal if it had to be pizza.  The sweetness of the corn, the creamy-yet-tangy zing of the goat cheese, the acidic & juicy splash of the tomatoes, the herbaceous freshness from the basil....simply perfection.
  
And the rocket man kicks a$$, too!  Who knew broccoli was so good on pizza?  And the sun-dried tomatoes on that pizza are like tiny red flavor bombs.  The sourdough crust serves as the perfect vessel for all their pies, with a perfect chewiness & flavor profile of its own.

Also, as others have mentioned, do not skip the pimento cheese (just get the chip/dip platter).  It is incredible.  Also also, their wings.  So damn good.  Not at all buffalo style, but made with a slightly sweet yet spicy flavor.  They are grilled (or baked in the blistering pizza oven) so that there is a slight char to them that is out of this world.",2016-02-17 17:07:05

1005,88,4.0,"When in Vegas you do things that you do not say and the things your friends shall not repeat!  

So lets say you are at a convention and having drinks when one of the guys tells you he has a cabana reserved at a nightclub called Surrender?  You look around and notice you are 10 guys, but you shrug your shoulders and hop in a limo to the Encore Hotel.

You then get there and find Bobby.  You tell Bobby that you reserved a cabana , give him a credit card and get your ID out to prove that you are twice the age limit which means you will be twice as fun.  The guy looks at you but does not think it is funny!  But as you whiz past the club hopefuls, you take note of everyone in the harsh lighting as you don't want to regret things later. As you enter the club they brand you with the ""over 40"" stamp and walk past the inside club which is dark and out into the shallow pool area which in the dream that I had is littered with young sirens in short dresses on lily pad like tables. It is a stadium-like atmosphere with tables and loungers around the pool and 2 floors of cabanas along the rim. For your money you will be happy to be outside with the big money players who are hoping to get played or to play you.  Fortunately this is only a dream and doesn't happen in real life. 

You get escorted to your cabana and your exotic cabana beauty named Shelley who is made up of what seems like 10 different ethnic backgrounds squeezed into a size zero dress  and 5 inch heels starts pouring drinks.  Remember that you are with 10 guys and the testosterone levels are raging.  Fortunately for Shelley there are scantily clad women lounging all around the cabana waiting for you to invite them over to drink your booze.  You watch as your friends somehow convince them to enter your den of wolves and look foolish.  Remember,  you took mental photos outside.  

Suddenly, like the movies, everything turns to slo-mo as cool people enter the cabana next door and start displaying the cool dance moves you once had before you had that accident where you damaged both your knees trying to ascend Everest for the 100th time.  The women look amazing and one of the guys invites you over and introduces himself.  He knows you are a baller as you shelled out dough to attract cabana babes.  He looks over your 10 homies and asks where the girls are.  You lie and tell him you are celebrating ""Ethan's Freedom and Divorce"".  You find out your new friend is from another club and he and ""his girls"" are VIP hosts and hostesses. And now the females come and introduce themselves and tell you they'd like to see you at their club!  They take some selfies with you and now you see your buddies gazing over.  The myth has now begun and you are a Vegas God for future stories. Lol!

The rest of the night is a blur.  You wake in the morning alone with no chickens or tigers in your room and a full set of teeth. You do have a stamp on your hand and a mouth full of cotton balls though.  Yep, it didn't happen like that.  Those pictures on your phone are fake.  It never happened and nobody will ever know.",2014-10-09 20:23:32

Can't cry at all about the Japanese Fried Chicken, either. This place is definitely worth the experience.

UPDATE: Drinks Review

Mad Man -- Rather interesting twist on the Manhattan. It took me a while to get used to the sippy straw but after a while you get the swag goin'. Points for sheer creativity on this one. 

Vanilla/Hickory Manhattan -- THIS is a drink that demands your respect. Yes, you're paying a bit for the process but even without it, it could easily be a $30-35 drink. It's like sipping on a toasted marshmallow (cuz there's no way you're chugging this).",2016-11-17 04:49:55

Usually I could have shrugged this off but this last time was most disappointing. My wife was just cut from a long double. When we walked in I noticed three very young snickering girls at the bar. The bartender approached us and after ordering our drinks he said he couldn't serve my wife because the manager, who was one of the snickering girls, believed she was intoxicated, which was quite the opposite. The girls sitting around the bar continued to laugh. Obviously we were way more aware than they realized. Normally they have decent bar food and good drink specials but if this how they treat customers they don't deserve business. The biggest complaint is their beer lines taste dirty.

My dog is bigger and stronger than me and I could not manage him - it was making my life miserable and was becoming dangerous for both of us.  I got hurt when he dragged me across the street on a walk, and I was afraid to have guests to our home as he would jump all over them.  I had tried another professional trainer without success and thought I would be stuck forever with a crazy dog I could not control.  Things are completely 100% different now.  Not only am I relieved, he is also a happier dog and is more content in our home.  All American K-9 tamed my wild beast and gave me back the happy family dog that I knew he could be.

728,458,5.0,So so good. Walked into this place after spending the afternoon in old montreal. They told me they were closing at 5 and I got there at 430 so I felt like I had to rush a bit. They also sold out of a few items when I got there so I settled for a grilled cheese which was super yummy with caramelized onions. The bread was also delicious. I also tried an almond croissant and it was awesome. Service was also excellent. Just not sure why they close so early.,2017-09-08 18:53:49

1788,589,1.0,I hadn't been to this restaurant in over a year and was looking to a good meal. I was seated in the garden room that I requested and there was only a couple of tables with customers. All the wait staff was near the kitchen talking with one another. No one came over until I frantically waved at the manager. Finally a waitress came over. I ordered the sauerbraten which I had always liked. It was tuff and chewy.

990,614,2.0,"Yeah, I'm not really sure what the fuss is about. 

When we arrived in Pittsburgh we heard about Primanti Bros. from everyone -- it was a Pittsburgh classic, a 'must try.' So, we went. Hubby got the pastrami sandwich (a much better choice, IMO) and I got the Pitts-burger. Both sandwiches were just...not worth a review, to be honest. It seems like Primanti tries to build impressive, Insta-worthy sandwich volume by piling bland slaw and soggy french fries on cheap white bread, and cuts corners on the actual meat quantity and quality. Oh, and maybe I'm being a princess here, but an actual plate would be nice. 

This is the original Primanti Bros. location, for what it's worth, so I guess if you want to underwhelm your Pittsburgh visitors with a disappointing sandwich, choose the Strip District location.",2015-07-24 15:25:39

Only one of the sites was really suited for exploring. I would have liked going to another site where we could walk around on rocks more, or just more time in general to hike. The day we went it was raining a little, so they didn't give us very much time at some of the stops, and I felt kind of rushed because of this. I understand they basically never get rain, but it was only a little drizzle, and we were on an adventurous tour. Otherwise, the tour guides are great.

Problem is the service....for the most part it's ok but whenever you call in they almost always put you on hold. Then it's a toss up on how long they leave you there...usually a min 2 mins up to 6 or 7 believe it or not.  Tried this the other day and was put on hold ....waited and waited....6 mins later still no response and I arrived at the location. I asked the server and she said there were only 2 of them and that's why they're told to put people on hold.  

That raises the obvious question...why do you only have 2 servers on an extremely busy Sat morning?...frustrating for customers and got a bit of attitude from the server for good measure....nice!",2017-05-13 14:45:53

For dinner my co-worker had both the bold n gold wings and the hot wings. She said both were good but gave an edge to the hot wings. 

I had the chorizo burger. It was good.   The side salad was a generous portion with cucumbers, tomatoes and cheese and not iceberg lettuce (thumbs up)!  The coleslaw was not doing it for me. One bite and that was it. 

Service was great. Drinks refilled timely. Team effort by the servers to make sure food was brought out promptly. Think we had 4 different servers bring us one thing or another.

The waiter was really nice and helpful, when we didn't know what we wanted exactly he gave us really good suggestions that we ended up following. His suggestions were great because I had no complaints about the food and the food was amazing.

For an appetizer we had the Garlic Shrimp Tamale. It was delicious, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the sauce went so well with the shrimp. Also the tamale really went with the shrimp.

We had 4 things, the Pork Tenderloin, Veal chop, Lamb chop and the roasted Brussels sprout salad . The Pork tenderloin was very soft and the sauce went well with it. I also liked how all the meat dishes came with a tamale, each with a different taste to go with it. It's been a quite a while since I ate at Mesa grill so I forgot what went with the Pork Tenderloin, I think it was a sweet Tamale. The Veal chop was so moist and soft. The ratio of fat to meat was perfect. The reason I really liked the Veal chop was that it was really juicy, but the juices don't flow out of the meat, but instead stay in the chop. I think the tamale I got with the Veal chop was a cheesy one. The Lamb chop was also really good, which is saying something as I don't normally like the taste of lamb. The brussel sprout salad was also delicious. The brussel sprouts were perfectly charred, and the pomegranates added a nice sweet touch.

I highly recommend eating here",2014-03-30 00:33:13

I have also tried the king pao chicken the sauce is perfect with their white rice, but I did not like the texture of the chicken it was to tough and chewy for me. the veggies they cook their aren't overcooked and good. I would definitely order from her again but I think I would stick to the vegetarian dishes or try something other than the chicken because I didn't like it, their soup is good too, if it wasn't for the chicken this place would have gotten more stars from me.

138,79,4.0,"I was brought here by my coworkers. It's become sort of a ritual at my office to bring any new employees or out-of-town visitors here for lunch. Kind of a test of character. We usually go at least once a month.

My typical order is jerk chicken fried rice and egg foo yung with another varying meat option. I've tried the black beans and have to admit they're pretty good but I'm just not a big fan of lentils. I prefer having more rice.

I love the egg foo yung. I dislike a lot of Americanized Chinese food dishes, but egg foo yung is one exception. My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top.

I finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas. My coworkers swear by the Jade Red Chicken inside a quesadilla. A strange combination, but it's actually really good. I've heard that machaca inside a quesadilla is also good.

It's a comfortable restaurant that's only been open for about two months. The meatballs were delicious and the menus were very original. I had the pork meatballs in a panini with Gouda and spinach almond pesto. The sauce was amazing. For a side I had the rocket salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Great atmosphere with the bar and stainless steel dining. Definitely going back again to try the other sauces. Our waiter told us they're going to have 3 floors with a rooftop area too.

It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The ""resort fee"" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money.

It is easy to make an appointment and every groomer is well trained and experienced. They work on all kinds and sizes of dogs and each looks amazing! I take my 3 Shuh Tzus there on a regular basis.

All of it is divine. A few of my personal favorites are the almond cupcakes (simply perfection), their cream filled punckis (sp? But it's all about the icing...) and their mini fruit tart (light and refreshing).

188,139,1.0,"Holy crap I am never doing this airline again! I know with budget airlines, you get what you pay for but this airline is beyond terrible and needs a lot of improvement. There are fees tacked on for everything and you have to be careful with what you are doing. This is my first time taking Allegiant and usually we take United Airlines. My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren't expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant's response was to ""do it yourself"". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude.

68,63,3.0,"OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now.
Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one. 
Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.
Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.
Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this ""ironic""; I say, ""tacky!"" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting ""Go back to Denny's"", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal.
So, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price.",2014-02-05 18:14:36
891,112,2.0,"After reading all these reviews for ""Cleveland's Best New Restaurant"", we had such high hopes for Butcher & The Brewer. Man, were we disappointed.

Let me tell you, I was not expecting to have AMAZING service, especially in a restaurant as big and as packed as this place (and since I am a server myself, I feel for these people running around like crazy) and we did go on a night with two concerts and a home Indians game. My boyfriend and I met up with some family friends of his and right when we sat down our waitress showed up to take our drink orders. I love beer, but seeing ""Draft Wine"" on the menu made my heart pitter-patter. My boyfriend stuck with the Farmhouse Rouge, while our friend ordered the Le Boucher and four appetizers for us to share right off the bat. This is, sadly, where things began to go downhill. My boyfriend's beer came out in a regular 12 oz. glass and it was a bright orange-y yellow color. The menu said that the Farmhouse Rouge was an amber, and I even commented how brightly colored it was, but continued sipping my DRAFT WINE (still excited about this). It was also a little hoppy for his taste at first, but the more he drank the more he enjoyed it. Our friend's Le Boucher was a deep maroon color that came in a smaller snifter glass. One by one, our appetizers arrived. The sliders, while a tad overcooked, were delicious thanks to the brioche bun and the spicy mayo. The corndogs were also delicious, no carnival wieners here. The whole wings (which were just okay) were brought out to us by our actual waitress, not a food runner, so we asked about our fourth and final appetizer we were waiting on, the one we were all the most excited about: the bone marrow. She said she would gladly go and check on it for us and that it should be up any minute. Well, that any minute soon turned into 20 minutes. Then 25 minutes. Our waitress came back to see if we needed any drinks, with no last appetizer in her hands. Our friend asked about the bone marrow AGAIN, and changed his beer to a Farmhouse Rouge, which my boyfriend ordered again and I ordered another glass of wine. 

Now things just get a little strange. The waitress comes back and tells us that they are out of bone marrow and have been all night. Considering we ordered the appetizers almost an hour prior and we were just being told this right then after asking about it several times, we were a little iffy. But mistakes do happen, and she said she would buy us the round of drinks we were waiting on for the trouble. In comes my wine, and then in comes the two snifters of a marooney, dark Farmhouse Rouge. WAIT, WHAT?? Right as she puts his glass down, my boyfriend looks at her and says, ""Wait, we both ordered the Farmhouse Rouge?"" and, kind of in a snotty tone, she replies, ""Yeaaaah, that's what this is."" Since he had ordered it before and this obviously was a completely different beer in color, taste, even glass it was served in, he asks what the first beer he was served actually was. She says she's not sure and walks away. Okay then? Today, we still have no idea what beer he drank when we arrived there. It will forever be a mystery. 

We decided to order entrees as well, and all I can say is stay away from the shrimp and grits. The grits, the poached egg, and the large pieces of pork belly were delicious on their own, but they couldn't save the dish from the very fishy shrimp. Instead of being plump and sweet, they tasted almost like shrimp cocktail, the kind you can tell aren't fresh and were probably frozen a while ago. For a $16 price tag, it just wasn't worth it. Come to this establishment for the beer (if you are actually served the one you order), the draft wine (STILL YAY!), and an appetizer, but don't expect stellar service or seafood for the price. Probably won't be returning or recommending it any time soon, and that makes me sad.",2015-07-28 15:04:07

Steamed dumplings are very good and so soupy. 
Snow pea sprouts are very good and good portion.

1605,489,4.0,"I wished upon a star that I would have been impressed even more with Fleur de Lys, but the touch and go execution and less than five star caliber service made this Top Chef Masters Vegas outpost fall short of a fifth.

For a fancy French restaurant, I was impressed with the understated elegance of the space.  Gorgeous floor to ceiling curtains add a soft contrast to the rose adorned stone wall.  The wine cellar on the second floor is definitely eye catching, but again, nothing over the top.  I wasn't a huge fan of the narrow, cramped lounge area in the front where we were asked to wait for our table.  The ""patio"" bar seating area outside the restaurant is less than stellar unless you like people walking up to your table to read the menu that's right in front of your table.  Past 10pm, you can hear the live band playing from across the hall, which I imagine can get a little annoying if you're there for an intimate dinner.

The four course tasting menu certainly had its highlights.  The truffled onion soup is the star of the tasting menu.  This is a masterfully executed dish - this is coming from a guy who's not a huge fan of onions either.  Flavors are delicately balanced.  Five stars.  I'm a short ribs fanatic and I have to admit I was not very impressed with my dish. The potato and carrot puree was incredible, but the short ribs was a bit tough and stringy on the outside - not fork tender.  I'd say 3.5 stars.  My friends ordered souffle - top drawer.  The salted fondit chocolate cake and popcorn ice cream was intriguing - if you like salty sweet flavors combined together.  On average, the food was 4 stars,

The execution of the dishes and particularly the service is where Fleur de Lys falls short of its five star reputation.  My friend's bacon wrapped seabass was cold and so she waited while we finished our second course before her replacement dish came out.  I understand these things happen, but this is a JV mistake at a varsity level restaurant.  Some of my fellow yelpers commented on the lackluster service.  We definitely felt that.  Beautifully prepared plates were destroyed due to poor presentation by the servers.  Dishes were nearly dropped.  Service felt too clinical, lacking in any warmth.  The bright star of course was the sommelier who offered a great wine pick from the menu.  Otherwise, I'd rate the service a 3.

For the most accurate gauge, I'd say the original SF outpost for a taste of Fleur de Lys' true potential.  Vegas outpost isn't bad at all, but it's not five star worthy in my book.",2010-02-02 07:00:49

Thai Snapper Ceviche-this was my favorite dish; bright and light flavors with a subtle heat
Ahi Tuna w/ fruit salsa- had a great spiciness to awaken your taste buds
Sunny side up egg w/ serrano ham & asparagus-crispy ham and a friend egg over toast was simply delicious
Bacon wrapped dates-everything I hoped they would be: sweet & salty & crunchy & chewy
Raclette- heart warming and flavorful gooey-cheesy baked Swiss dish
Mixed greens salad- great combination of acidity and earthiness 
Roasted beets w/ whipped goat cheese and pistachio-my favorite vegetable dish 
Diver sea scallops atop a polenta cake- great textures and flavors, a must-order!
Beef filet with crostini & blue cheese- classically delicious and perfectly cooked

New Years I had a table on the dance floor. The place was so packed with drunk guys. We had 2 bottles knocked off the table by drunk people. We had so much alcohol that I didn't really even care. The biggest problem was the lack of security which allowed for creepy guys to bump into and knock over the girls with me. We left at like 1:30 which is really early in vegas. That's how bad it was.

The little guy working the front needs to get a clue. He yells at his own staff in front of customers. I can't even begin to explain how bad this makes your club look. Everyone is pissed off and stressed out which trickles down to the customer. LAVO check your cameras on this guy.

Anyhow...go somewhere that actually takes care of their customers.  Lavo has too much of an ego for what it is. The girls always clear out and go somewhere else at 2am too. I'm never going back to this place.",2010-04-10 19:14:56

And without doubt .. the fountains of bellagio are one of those things which look even better in real life .. though off late things have become more flashy in reel life :P but not this one :) 
It is just a great feeling to be able to stand there, right on the rails and watch those fountains dance ..

No, you won't come to Vegas just to watch these fountains dance but if you are here I doubt if you would want to go past 'em without stopping :)
And some people would rather skip ""viva las vegas"" to take a pic with the bootys for instagram or whatever .. I would not :)",2018-04-27 19:43:42

1620,577,3.0,"Service: great! The waitress who took our orders and the guy that delivered our foods to the table were friendly and attentive.

Foods: Not very pleased! The sauce were almost bland (we got the sampler). It seems like the seafoods were frozen and as they cooked, the ice thawed out and watered down the sauce. At least that's how I'd imagine what happened. The crab itself was very salty though.

Prices: I expect for seafoods to be slightly expensive but I'd willingly pay that price if the food tastes weren't disappointing!

Happy ending: it was my birthday. They gave me free dessert!",2017-12-17 21:21:34
360,163,4.0,"Chris G. makes a good point about not arriving too early and I would say the same for arriving late. They kind of shorten the conveyor and do not replace the old stuff with fresh stuff. Our personal experience has been that the best time is generally between 6PM and 8PM. To grab fresh stuff off the belt that is. 

As mentioned by other reviewers, they'll make rolls fresh for you. The other reviews are all pretty much on the money. It's definitely a fun place to go with friends and affordable.

Never did get their pizza, although I seen it pass by a few times...Ordered their lemon Veal, and it was simply amazing. could cut through it with your fork. The waitstaff here was spot on, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was beautiful...felt like you were in a little eatery in Italy. The prices are right...you get a good size portion - didn't order any appetizer...although they did bring out this very fresh, warm bread...which hit the spot! Was so hungry! 

the wine was brought out in a little glass canister, and was enough for two glasses.

1805,540,4.0,"Just keep it coming! Love these kinds of steak houses. Other places give u a small filet on a fancy plate for like $65 and they think they are doing you a favor. Pampas has a groupon for $65 which covers dinner for two (And all the meat you can eat!). Also included is two drinks up to 12 dollars each, and a dessert. 
    First of all, we made a reservation. They were really nice and even let us put it back 45 minutes when we were running late. As soon as we sat down we were greeted by our server. Love that. He went over the ground rules: Green means go. Red means stop. Enjoy! My wife and I hit the salad bar first. Nice touches with things like artichoke slices and already tossed caesar salad. A couple of notes there, 1) No ranch dressing or iceberg lettuce. I know this is a semi-fancy place, but keep it real.
2) Awesome job of having a section full of garlic mashed potatoes and rice. Ribs and hot wings also at the ready. Soups and breads also offered. All tasted pretty good, and I just wish there was Ranch! Maybe next time I will bring my own. 
    Now to the star of the show. ""Would you like leg of lamb?"" Yes!"" Filet wrapped in bacon?"" Yes! Shrimp and Scallions wrapped in prosciutto were wonderful. All of the meat that we piled onto our plates somehow disappeared. (We will have to call and have that investigated) 
    Dessert was a lovely Tiramisu and was very good. Overall, I really like this place. They were good with keep up with my appetite, which was a task in and of itself. My wife thought everything was perfect. Just a great value with the groupon.",2013-07-20 20:47:00

the star of the evening was our waiter chris.  he was so engaging, professional and friendly.  we absolutely adored him.  chris took our lovely dinner to extraordinary and he is an asset to rm seafood.  we visited many restaurants during our time in vegas and i can honestly say that chris is hands down the best server.",2017-08-28 20:09:10
1429,557,5.0,"Located off the strip in Downtown Las Vegas, the crowd and vibes are way more relaxed. 
This spot was a little tricky to find but when we finally did, we were so glad we didn't give up! 
One of the employees met us outside and recognized our look of confusion and showed us the way.

We were seated indoors right away at a communal high top table because we desperately needed AC. But if you love the sun, you can eat on the outdoor rooftop patio and bar. 

The first thing I noticed were the actual menus which were so unique. I immediately knew that the food would be amazing because if someone puts that much thought into a menu, then they've definitely put a lot of thought and care into crafting delicious cocktails and dishes.

We ordered the Machu Peach-U cocktail. It was a peachy take on a Peruvian Pisco sour, with Smith & Cross Jamaica rum, Giffard crème de pêche, Barso pisco, fresh lemon & lime, bar keep saffron bitters, and finished with a fluffy egg white on top. I loved it!

Our first appetizer was the KILLER SHRIMP with rocoto & aji amarillo pepper cream. It looked and tasted similarly to Walnut Shrimp from a Chinese restaurant, minus the walnuts, and had a spicy kick at the end.  

Our second app were the PORK WINGS with buffalo bleu beurre blanc. They were the most succulent juicy pork belly bites dipped in a little buffalo sauce. They were finger licking good!!

Next we ordered the baked mac n cheese. I'm not sure what cheeses were used but it was creamy, dreamy, delicious. 

Our entrée was the COCOA-ESPRESSO NY STRIP with red wine demi. It was perfection! I couldn't distinguish the cocoa or espresso flavors, but they must've worked well together because I took pleasure in each juicy bite. 

Dessert... Oh, my...
I love donuts. I love bread pudding. And yes, 
they actually made a GLAZED DONUT BREAD PUDDING!!!! It was almost shaped like a mushroom- the top was donut and it became softer at the base, almost like flan. I had the biggest smile of sheer bliss on my face and I closed my eyes to make the flavors and that feeling last as long as possible.

We had been visitors before the remodel some years back and never made a visit to the remodeled El Chorro. While I miss the funky décor of old Scottsdale, I like the updated version also! 

We visited on a very chilly night and after a drink at the bar, my husband suggested we have our early dinner outside on the patio under all the heaters. I scoffed. It's really cold. The hostess suggested blankets. So she pulled out cozy blankets to cover our chilly laps! After sitting at our intimate table underneath the heaters, I really didn't need it and enjoyed the moonlit sky.

Our server was Andre and he was great! Attentive and friendly without being too chatty. My husband had the sea bass and I had the pork tenderloin. We also had the wedge salad. Sticky buns yummy as always! Our food was moist, delicious and perfectly cooked. Soooo happy! Only complaint was that our wedge salad (which Andre had divided into two for us) had too much dressing on it.
Second complaint was that the food was so good, I overate. My pooch is sticking out as I write.

In our conversation, Andre mentioned that there was a new chef in the kitchen when we said how great our food was. Strongly recommend El Chorro.",2013-12-08 03:09:51
795,322,1.0,"After reading reviews, we decided to finally try Avenue B as it had been on our list for quite some time. I have to say, I found everything about this place to be lackluster. We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can't think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It's possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I'm already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge. There are much better options in the city, both cheaper and better, and I will not be returning to Avenue B.",2017-03-15 01:57:34
1058,305,4.0,"This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem located around 20 minutes northwest of the Vegas Strip. We dropped by for a quick brunch, not knowing how long we were going to spend at Red Rock Canyon. I knew a lot of  people in the area rave about this place so I definitely had to try it out. It was packed to the brim on a Tuesday morning, which shocked me! They have everything from sandwiches to meats to breads and of course everyone's favorite, their pastries. Service was so/so but I would understand because the restaurant was so busy. There are newspapers in the front that look like daily news but it is actually their gigantic menu so it took us awhile for us to decide what we wanted. 

I ended up getting their Smoked Turkey with Avocado, Tomato, and Bacon, which only comes in the bigger half pound portions. Be warned because I was expecting a small bite but their sandwiches are huge and is pretty much 1.5x meals for me but there is absolutely no sharing! Their turkey was a little dry but I'm glad they didn't skimp on the amount of turkey they gave. I was surprised that they gave a pickle beside the sandwich because I'm a huge fan of pickles but I only ended up eating half of it because of how salty it was. With the sandwich, you have a choice of a side, which I chose potato salad and it was on the creamier side, which I didn't mind.

The bouncer insisted that he couldnt do anything about it and that we had to pay (he was really really cocky) so we ended up walking away and planned to head to another club instead. As we were walking further away, another bouncer chases after our group and tells us that he can get us in for free...fine.

When we got in it was super packed and the music totally sucked! This place is really nice but the people who work here are all  SUPER cocky and they need to learn how to have more of a variety for music..not trance all night!!!!!

A tip I learned from other reviews and am going to emphasize: cheaper seats such as the 300s and late 200s are good because there is one section of the show where a good majority of the seats are covered by a white sheet. Everyone underneath can't see a thing, but there is still a show going on above the sheets. I just feel like if you're goign to be spending 80+ dollars to see a show, you'd like to see EVERYTHING.

Visited El Hefe this past weekend and had a great experience. Service was top notch, food came out quickly, and the drinks certainly were the highlights. 

If you noticed my prior review, I am pleased to share the entire staff, management, and everyone we encountered was polite, friendly, and very accommodating. 

Jessica served us and she was a delight! Very attentive and made our experience really sweet. 

Guys-- the eye candy at El Hefe is reason enough to go... And if you're planning on bringing your lady, just keep your eyes glued on your date so you don't get in trouble drooling... Because this place may be one of the best places to watch any game, fight, or match on their huge and many TVs. 

The selection of tequila & beer should meet any preferences or demands. We drank Casa Noble and had a delish margarita. Very good!!! 

The food is a big step up from typical bar food, but don't expect authentic Mexican cuisine. They offer a great selection of tacos and snacks to pair your appetite for drinks. We loved the macho nachos and there's no way 2 people can eat all those chips piled high with all that yummy cheesy goodness. For a sun night out or to watch any exciting game, you will enjoy the snacks and the killer drink selection. 

Coming back a second time, I made sure to seek out the management crew and shared my thoughts about my experiences. My biggest advice is seek out Rob, Erik, or Jamie if anything is either really good or really bad-- these guys truly care about the customer experience, and are striving to make El Hefe remarkable. 

While I had my doubts, I am a fan and will be back during my visits to AZ!

It got interesting from there:

My tech & another female proceeded to crowd around me & talk over me in another language. From the laughing & talk about days off I'm guessing it want for training purposes. She would stop for extended periods of time for this conversation. 

1: My tech pressed her vagina all over my shoulder / arm. THE ENTIRE TIME. 

2: Wiped my face with her hands as she worked. As opposed to a tissue and / or brush like other locations use. 

3: She also decided that ""thick & full brows with an arch"" means ""thin with an arch"". I had to tell her to stop bc she was just kept taking more off. 

4: She leaned into me and put her elbow between my breasts, pressing into my chest. WTF?!

I swear I look like a dang fairy coming out of there. Going in as a 6 and coming out as an 11 lol. Anyways, I tried a different location because I found a groupon code for that specific place, (I love deals and coupons) but lashes weren't their specialty. So I reverted back since they opened their new location on LV Blvd. I got a great deal but was worried that I wasn't able to get an appointment time since it was a bit late notice and very close to my departure date. Any who, I called and they worked with me. I was so so so so so so thankful for the appointment maker and boss, and my eyelash stylist DALINE! Granted I had no stinkin idea what I wanted because I always forget, but she recommended what would last longest and what would look best on my original lashes. I am so very impressed with the way they turned out, I have nothing but amazing things to say about my visit. By the way, if you're wondering if you could trust your original lashes with these women, yes.. You definitely can.

You make a reservation for a room like us as we had a reservation for a non smoking king room and when we got to the front desk they told us that they only had queen beds in which they can't guarantee that you will get what you booked for as that is not at all the way to do business. They also tried to charge us for the room in which we were not going to stay in at all unless we got what we wanted as I had to fight the hotel manager for a full refund. A reservation should guarantee exactly what kind of room you are requesting with no if's and or butts.

In my opinion, it's worth trying out if you don't walk in with high expectations for food and service.",2015-04-28 22:08:34

Ordered two types of pizza, came in a timely fashion and everything was going great until I found some type of plastic half way through the meal....big disappointment. I should have gotten up and left but the waitress was nice and said they would come the whole meal and get me a new pizza. After waiting for the new pizza, already losing my appetite, I ate a slice and got the rest to go.  Before the check arrives the manager come to our table (I thought just to apologize about the food) and says he's sorry but the waitress miss spoke and only that pizza was getting comped. Talk about failed opportunity to fix a fault. Big slap in the face. It would take a bit to get me to want to return.",2015-11-06 04:30:54
1441,69,4.0,I was seated immediately despite the crowd. The food was interesting and very good. As an appetizer I ordered the Guy Italian with a cheese fondue dip.   Very favorable and outside the norm.  I ordered the Mac and cheese burger which would have relieved four stars but I ate half of a beef dip sandwich that was off the hook with flavor.  The fries were also a medley of different fries. A bit salty but delicious. Another must try place. I'd come back.,2015-11-12 16:21:53

300,631,1.0,"My friends and I were very excited to have brunch in a nice French restaurant while in Las Vegas. However, our experience was quite disappointing.

The 20 minute wait to be seated was completely reasonable. But the 20 minute wait to get our order taken and then the 40 minutes it took them to prepare 2 sandwiches, a bowl of soup, and one pastry is unspeakable for such a high-end restaurant. We were wondering what took them so long to prepare our food and then realized it was so they could turn a ""medium rare"" steak sandwich into an overcooked piece of wood. We probably would have sent it back, but it would have taken another 40 minutes and we were very hungry by that point.

Our waitress did not offer much detail or information about the menu to our group, which was clearly not well-versed in French. She was also very slow to refill our water glasses, and when she did, the water was lukewarm. I was wondering if this was a French thing, but saw that other tables were offered pitchers of ice water.

Glad I decided to eat an egg and cheese biscuit in the Venetian food court before heading up and waiting an hour to eat a $10 cup of soup in Bouchon.",2013-09-04 02:00:58

1261,28,4.0,"It's a really cute place with overpriced food, great service, and live music. 

Located right in the heart of Old Montreal, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot right when they opened on a Friday. We were seated in their covered terrace while the band was setting up. Our server was attentive, kind, and helped us decide what to get.

The drinks were surprisingly strong, especially for noon on a Friday. My Moscow Mule was nice and strong and my girlfriend really enjoyed her smoothie. We ended up sharing the baked goat cheese and the local cheese plate. The goat cheese was wrapped in a flaky pastry and served over a pesto sauce and a red pepper sauce. Really good. The cheese was all local and pretty decent, but it could have been bigger for the price.

You come here for the experience, not really for the food. All in all, a really fun place!",2017-07-20 01:01:45
601,72,5.0,"Buffets are overrated and the free breakfast at your mid-budget hotel is just cellophane bagels and hard-boiled eggs.  Solution?  The Peppermill.  It's freestanding, not buried in some casino, so you can park for free and be in the door right away.  If there is a wait, go hang out in the Fireside Lounge and have a delicious Bloody Mary.  It will quiet the demons.  

Upon entering, you will see that the pink, purple, and aquamarine color scheme is so becoming when combined with the thousands of disco-ball mirrors lining the ceiling. Fuchsia neon gives the place all the warmth of a stretch limo circa your cousin's quinceanera in 1986.  The flamingo-patterned Tiffany-esque lampshades are the essence of class, as are the velour booths.  On every table is a dispenser full of rainbow sugar which matches the decor.

If you think all this sounds cheesy, I want you to know that the place is in perfect condition and squeaky, crazy, pristine clean.  Yes, there is a jungle of silk plants but not a speck of dust anywhere.  It is a lovely, inviting restaurant.  If you have ever been to the Madonna Inn, you will know what I am talking about: well-maintained kitsch is like a beautiful rhinestone-bedazzled Nudie suit one is never ashamed of wearing.  

The breakfast portions are enormous.  The fruit plate is more like a party platter for 12.  Two people could split an omelet and leave the table full.  The hash browns are crispy, not soggy or greasy.  

These are restorative foods.  Combined with the Peppermill's professional, attentive service, you can feel your hangover receding with each bite.  I always leave the Peppermill ready for my day's events, whether sunburning by the pool, shopping in the outlets, hiding in a dark hotel room watching ""Ladyhawke,"" gambling away my retirement savings, or braving the gridlock on the 15.

It was dark, dank, crowded & tight, hard to read complicated menus (plastered on old record covers; a cute idea, but I couldn't read the small print in the dimly lit room) bring a magnifying glass... noisy, expensive, tight crowded seating, poor service-took forever to get my sandwich, sorry but it shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a grilled cheese sandwich. Hard to eat thick slices of bread - how the heck can you get a 3 inch tall sandwich in your mouth. The bread slices are an inch thick, slathered with butter or oil (not sure what they use) a small amount of filling in comparison. Basically an artery clogging heart attack on a plate! Served with cold fries, My sandwich was all wet from the pickle juice it was sitting in from the garnish pickle slice ""INEDIBLE""

The decor consists of hundreds of Halloween & Christmas light-up lawn ornaments lit up with strings of twinkle lights here and there (cute two times a year, but I don't want to see snowman, rabbits, pumpkins and Santa while having dinner lining the walls.

You had to wait in long lines to get cocktails - but everyone was so nice you ended up not minding....that much. The acoustics we're great for JT but the opening act - not so much.

Toasted and cheesy :) The Red Goat salad is delicious with pistachios, goat cheese, strawberries, and their to-die-for balsamic vinaigrette! Mac n Cheese is a hit as well! 

The service has always been poor, but that has become expected. It takes a long time to be greeted, and expect your glass to be empty for awhile before they come around to offer you another.

Their dry and bland burritos lacked fresh authentic ingredients and were replaced by an excess of what tasted like unseasoned beans straight out of the can. The disappointingly small portions of rice and beans would have usually bothered me but after one bite the rest ended up in the trash anyway. 

The service was terrible- and we got it to go... They confused our order, couldn't remember which burrito was which, and while we were waiting, we couldn't help but notice how dirty the silverware was on their appropriate abundance of unoccupied dining tables.

My only thing is that it looked like a cup and the soup was not too fresh. It was good though.

But as a former Flagstaffian, the Bookmans in Phoenix is nowhere near as plentiful and varied in content matter as is the Flagstaff Location...nor does it have a cafe, which is a must for a bookstore I feel. Furthermore, the trade credit dollars given have shrunk in comparison to the rise in the price of books on the shelves anymore. I understand that this is a business needing to make money to sustain, but sometimes it feels like I am being ripped off on both ends of the spectrum. Furthermore, there are several items I have purchased and then been told, not even one month later (and upon losing the receipts so just trying to take the item back for a lesser amount in trade credit) that they are not interested in rebuying from me. I wish there was some way the Bookman stores would intertrade stock, so that the same books are not always on the shelves. I rarely find a science book that is unique to the stock on hand anymore, and only go in maybe once a month if that. I wish there were more used bookstores in the area of Bookmans, because if anything it would force them to stay more honest and competitive..versus the monopoly it holds on the surrounding area which results many times in a more lackluster brand of service and selection because it can.",2013-01-27 21:03:49

I met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine. 

There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink. 

I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling.

Everyone I knew absolutely RAVED about this place, so one evening, my family and I went. The service was awful, the food was cold, and they brought me out food with an allergen on it (which I SPECIFICIALLY told the server about). We chalked it up to the thought that this place is known for breakfast, and we were there in the evening. Our fault; let's try again in the morning sometime.

So we did. Again... epic failure. The service was terrible, the food was mediocre, and we had to ask repeatedly for someone to even bring our drinks  (yes, that's part of service, but deserves its own mention). It's been a few months now, but I just can't see going back.

Pizza seems like the only choice, so it was so great to find a real restaurant by such a great chef open late to serve hungry people. We attended a concert on a Monday and we didn't get out until very late and were needed to eat some food. This place did not disappoint. We got seated right away and our waiter was amazing. He was incredibly on point with the menu and able to answer any questions from our group. My husband and I shared a salad and a burger. I told the waiter that  we were sharing and they evenly split both items, which was really great. The Cesar salad was simple but the dressing was amazing and evenly coated the lettuce. It came with cherry tomatoes and unlike most restaurants that serve things that look like tomatoes but never actually tastes like them, these were amazing, they were sweet and actually tasted like a real tomato. The burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. It came with fries too which were great.Three of us all got  the same burger. One friend got a pepperoni pizza and was very pleased and someone got the crab cakes. Once the food arrived no one spoke, everyone amerced themselves in eating and everyone was incredibly pleased. there were several cocktails - two moscow mules and I had an amazing cocktail here is was a lima sour I believe and it was plum/lime inspired.

Our server Fred had no intuition or common sense. When we asked him for extra napkins, he brought 1 (1!) napkin. He forgot to get my toddler a drink and when he remembered he brought it in an enormous glass cup. Toddlers are fantastic with large full cups. After our food was delivered he checked on us (duly noted, points given) then disappeared for 45 minutes. I had to ask another server for our check, and she seemed so annoyed that we dared to bother her. As for Fred, he was too busy flirting to pay attention to his tables. I hope he got some numbers. 
I understand that hiring a young waitstaff is exciting because they are cute & nice to be around. They can also be inexperienced. That inexperience can come off as arrogance and hurt your business.

I wanted to speed to SnapDragon and beg their forgiveness for cheating. 

Flash forward a few months and my thick, ethnic, wavy (just plain difficult) hair grew back enough to be ready for a fix. Sure enough, Michaela worked her magic. The layers are blended and virtually disappear into one another rather than remaining like a tiered cake.

Yes, their prices are a bit higher than other salons, but you get what you pay for. What is a few extra dollars spread out over a few months? I'll skip a Starbucks or two to have my hair looking nice every day for months!!!

ONLY other drawback is limited parking.

I echo many other reviews; owner Kandi (sp?) and Jenny are amazing with cut and color in every circumstance. Both perfectionists and always speaking the truth; if they don't think your hair is the type that will hold that color or be right for that cut, they'll tell you!

The bar tenders are great and understand how to have a conversation with customer. After my third visit the bar tenders pretty much memorized what I drink. The service is always very prompt.

Let's be honest, this food isn't special. The breakfast cost me $9.35~ roughly for two eggs, two pancakes, and two slices of toast. The pancakes were doughy/mushy in the middle, the eggs were nothing special, and the toast was drenched in fake imitation butter, or whatever the bulk business brand is for the equivalent of ""Parkay."" I thought the place was pretty dirty. As I walked in, I saw a lot of dust hanging down from the ceiling. The first coffee cup I picked up had food from the previous use still on it.

Highly understaffed and rude to boot.

First off all you'd have to be drunk to enjoy the awful food and since we are having trouble even ordering a drink it's just a miserable experience.

141,94,2.0,"When it comes to the usual Costco deals and weekly road shows, this Costco is fine, but there are two big problems with this store:

1. In the last few months, the sample severs have gotten increasingly cranky and sometimes outright hostile. They have always been rude to my kids, who are generally polite, but today takes the cake. The server CHEWED out my son for touching one sample, then the other. Normally, that would be bad beahvior, but these were fully wrapped chocolates, not some greasy fish stick. The guy -- who was working the CHRISTMAS SECTION --  was so mad, I had to tell my son not to worry about it as we quickly walked away.

About half of the servers at this store are polite enough, but NONE of them EVER SMILE.

2. Even worse than the servers are the patrons, who are horrid creatures reminiscent of goblins from the Hobbit. Here are some examples:

*One time, two elderly women started swearing at each other as they fought for the parking spot I was trying to vacate. One woman, whose husband was driving in circles on the opposite side of the parking lot, literally stood in the spot I left while the other tried to run her over. I wish I was exaggerating, but I had to roll up my windows so the kids couldn't here the exchange of swear words. 

*My kids have been shoved out of the way of samples as if they have no right to be there.

*My kids have been rammed with carts by impatient shoppers who don't seem to understand that youngsters can get disorientated by the frenetic nature of that particular store. Heck, the traffic jams near the ready-to-eat chicken area can run 10-15 carts deep.

*I've had customers literally push us out of the way to lay claim to some product or another.

The staff is okay at this store, which I've frequented since 2008, but they don't work as hard at being friendly or helpful compared with other stores I've visited. I don't know what, if anything, they can do about the bad customers, but it seems they should at least be aware that the Scottsdale store is out of control.",2014-10-11 05:12:18

TIPS:
The recommendation to arrive two hours early is a good one.

Lyft or Uber to an off-the-Strip car rental for cheaper and far shorter lines.  Stay clear of the Budget near the airport.

Car rental pick-up/return is quite a ways from the terminal.  Give yourself extra time.

Know that slots at the airport pay even less frequently than at major Strip casinos.

My husband I chose classics: manicotti and cheese ravioli- $25.95 each. They tasted frozen and processed- not authentic. 

Each meal comes with a house salad, red and/or white House wine, garlic bread and a cappuccino.  The salad was so-so. It has a slice (like you would get at the deli counter) of salami in it with a hunk of processed mozzarella cheese and is slightly overdressed.   The wine was for sure cheap, but I wasn't expecting anything fancy considering it was included. The meal, depending on what you picked, doesn't take too long to get there but again, isn't anything to write home about.  It seemed like previously frozen, processed pasta- not homemade- with processed cheeses and canned sauce. I've had better at chains. The garlic bread wasn't fresh- seemed like it had been sitting a while and was hard. I tasted the cappuccino and it was ok but had a strong nutty flavor, almost like pecan.

The rooms are spacious but the beds are not very comfortable.  Even though it was nice that the hotel didn't have a casino, thus no smoke, it would have been convenient to have its own pool.

800 degrees offers individual pizzas which are made to order. They feature both traditional and some modern takes on pizza. They are all very reasonably priced for a 13"" hand stretched pizza. 

We ordered the piccante and zucca both were good. The piccante was very spicy due to the Calabrian chilies which were put on it. However, ours had more of the oil and less of the peppers than I would have liked. This made the crust a little soggy. 

The zucca was very good, but I felt that it was a little light on the toppings, I would have liked to see a little more quash on it and onions. 

I felt that the oven was a little hot and therefore the bottom of the pizza didn't get golden brown. But I guess it is called 800 degrees. 

We also ordered a couple of their beers on tap and they paired perfectly. Overall good experience, although my card got rung up incorrectly and a $15 tip was placed on a $40 order.

601,333,4.0,"Watching a Thunder from Down Under show for the first time feels like an initiation.  Like discovering a secret place where it's socially acceptable for everyday women to completely lose their minds.

I was planning on staying coherent enough to write an anthropological study on this phenomenon, but it was too powerful even for me.  Before I knew it, I, too, was screaming giddily and spilling my vodka cranberry on the poor lady next to me.

In my addled state of mind, I couldn't tell you too many details about the show itself.  It's basically a mix of acts.  Group dances, one-person dances, bits where the host calls people on stage.  The dances usually end with a random audience member chosen and brought up on stage for some very classy second-base fondling.  The music and costumes are gloriously cheesy (""Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy,"" natch).  The performers don't stick to the stage, so don't be surprised if a sweaty buff man in kneepads jumps up onto your table and gyrates his speedo in your face.  I mean, maybe that doesn't surprise you anyway, but just a heads-up.

Though I didn't find the show particularly titillating, the big emotional impact came from being surrounded by a vortex of screaming women and from being in close proximity to really hot, shirtless guys.  There was also the mixture of abject horror and fascination that came with watching a grandmother who looked like Mrs. Doubtfire eagerly reaching into a guy's leather pants and stroking him.  I don't know about you, but that's not something I get to see every day.  

If you go with a group of your spunkiest friends, the fun increases exponentially.  I recommend that you get liquored up beforehand, as the drinks in the theater are overpriced and a bit slow in coming (like your mum).     

There's no stuffing of cash into G-strings, but the performers take photos after the show for $20 (cash).  You should do this, because you are creepy like me. 

The shirtless guy taking my money: What's your name?  
Me: Rebecca.
Shirtless guy: Oh.  That's Bicky.  We'd call you Bicky in Australia.
Me: Yes.  Yes, sir.
Shirtless guy: (leading me to the sofa) Everyone, this is Bicky.

Then followed an odd moment when I realized just how incredibly sweaty these men get.  They pulled me down on their laps (I swear) and they were soaked.  I almost slid off.  There were towels piled under the sofa.  Luckily I know the butterfly stroke and was able to get out of there.  

P.S.  The current performers are a lot better-looking than the ones on the posters and promotional materials, some of which look to be from 1998.  Don't worry, ladies.  The new ones look nothing like the curly-haired guy from Color Me Badd.",2013-08-07 17:03:39

The location doesn't lend a whole lot to the ambiance but the interiors and outdoor seating are pretty good.What matters the most though, the pie and the wine selection. Decent mix of local and international full bodied wines. The test has to be based on a margherita and a white pie for which I pick the Wiseguy (it has pistachios). Also threw in a gnocchi for good measure since was with an equally hungry friend. The margherita thin, crispy and flavorful. The wise one with pistachios equally good. The unexpected winner was the creamy and home made fresh potato pasta gnocchi.

864,9,1.0,"Total: $81 for 3 people

We, myself and two family members came in on a Sunday night. First red flag the place was completely empty at 7:00pm. The restaurant was recommended by a close friend so we decided to give it a fair chance.

Roti Telur: 8/10- tasty and authentic (my favourite of the night)
Young chow fried rice: 6/10- nothing special, bland
Singapore fried mee hoon- 7/10- flavourful, but not many shrimp (2 in total)
Lamb Rendang; 5/10- taste of curry not bad, quality of meat was terrible
Sizzling chicken: 7/10: tasty but small portions of meat

For desert we chose the fried banana Grenade, which was absolutely terrible. The bananas were not ripe and the oil in which they were fried had a disgusting aftertaste, indicating it was old oil. We were very unimpressed with this dish.

Overall, especially with the terrible desert and a meal that was $81 for 3 people- this was unsatisfactory.",2016-01-04 06:02:00

Other dishes at the table - chicken club sandwich (reportedly VERY good) and a cheeseburger (reported as Ok, but he ate it all so it couldnt have been too bad!!)

249,413,3.0,"To start this review off, let me just say that I am not really a fan of buffets in vegas. I've never really preferred massive quantity for mediocre quality. That being said, I think Wicked Spoon is okay. We got there at 5PM on a saturday before the rush started, so you'll do yourself a favor if you get there early. We chose to go early because who likes to be full of food when they go out later that night? Not me. 

The food was pretty decent. I tried the truffled potatos, the shrimp miso, spinach salad, and a few other choice items. All in all, not that bad. I did like the fact that they were also plated separately, which made it easier and gave points for presentation. But, presentation doesn't make it for me entirely. Some of the stuff was also a bit overcooked. 

The dessert were also a big draw for me to these types of things, I tried one of each and didn't really find anything that stood out as well. It was all packaged wonderfully though (once again, points for presentation) but to be honest, the only thing I really liked was the chocolate covered strawberries and the Chocolate mousse/berry thing they had. The gelato was 'meh' since it tasted like the typical gelato stuff. 

All in all, not bad, but I probably wont be spending $37.50 + Tip for something like this again. I think although it is nice and everything, it is NOT WORTH $37.50, hence it is only Ok.",2011-08-04 15:58:06

601,632,4.0,"After Baker to Vegas this weekend, my husband and I hit this place up for a good and cheap dinner.  We were covered in dust and looked like desert rats, but the mixture of clientele at Tacos El Gordo was less than judgmental and I felt quite welcome.

The restaurant (on a Saturday night around 8ish) was brightly lit and chaotic with patrons.  The long lines meant a long wait, especially for adobada, which is much, much better than the carne asada, which is good but not great.  

The homemade tortillas are about the size of your palm.  A taco with everything comes with meat, onions, cilantro, lime, salsa and a smooth avocado sauce that wasn't exactly guacamole.  I also had a quesadilla, which is the same thing as a taco but with good white cheese stuck to the tortilla and a fried tortilla on top.  

Order your tacos first, then go pay at the cashier to get your cups for drinks.  There's a soda machine and an horchata machine, the kind with the happy face logo that says ""Ole!""

The fries with meat (carne asada, adobada, or a mixture of the two which is called campechana, I think) is a three-pound box filled with everything your cardiologist doesn't want you to eat.  Cheese, fries, crema, meat.  You can share this among four people and you will probably still not finish it.

Tacos are two dollars each.  A meal with a drink will be about $10-12 dollars, which is a lot for a taco joint.

However, the people watching is first-rate.  Besides Mexican families and the occasional adventurous Midwesterner, customers include hotel workers, drunken frat boys, and honest-to-goodness prostitutes.  At the table next to ours, there was a lively and profanity-spangled discussion in Spanish about the true definition of a chilango.  On the patio, a group of young men in their early-twenties with matching vests and threaded eyebrows fortified themselves before a night of what would no doubt be the liberal distribution of rohypnol.  All of these people and more you will find at the Las Vegas Strip Tacos El Gordo.  All united in taco solidarity.  This is a good place.",2013-04-16 20:56:17

They keep you entertained by making onion volcanoes and trying to throw shrimp into your mouth.

1150,332,5.0,"5 stars.  This is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh, in my humble opinion.  *Disclaimer*  I studied Spanish in college, have been to Spain twice, and likely have a nostalgia for that culture and food that really hits me in the feels.  Regardless, I was recently at a tapas bar/restaurant in DC that didn't even come close to Morcilla.

Where to start?  The beauty of a tapas style restaurant is that the portions are small and offer a perfect couple of bites between two people, so you can really start anywhere and circle around the menu to your heart's content.  Although if you had to ask me, I'd say you should start at the oxtail and blood sausage.  After you've kick started your senses, meander around to the restaurant's take on Spanish tortilla and choose some sort of oily fish to cleanse your palate.  Finally, bask in all the glory of España and savor some jamon Iberico along with a sherry (or several).

If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.

This place is fantastic! Sweet and Savory Crepes!? Unbelievable! I think the price is just right, because it is a specialty dish so I don't have any problem paying the $7 for an amazing crepe. The First Time dessert crepe is to die for, as well as the Chicken Griddle.

Be sure to try one of the Grown Up Sodas they have in the fridge. I spoke to the owner about them and he just got them and they are fantastic! (And I'm not really a soda kinda guy)

I thoroughly recommend this place to anyone, I just found it last week and have already been there twice since and have recommended it to everyone I know!",2012-09-10 19:43:55

1717,527,5.0,"Had researched many places to eat for our trip to the Phoenix area and this restaurant kept popping up as a place that was a MUST DO.  So, we headed that way, an hour out of our way and would absolutely do it again if I was in the area again.  The combination or the food and service, made the trip absolutely worth it.  The food is a plenty but it all looked so good, we did not hold back.  We ordered the garden hash which came with organize veggies, the potatoes were fantastic and the other veggies were not overcooked, with this for a $2.00 up charge, I ordered the cinnamon bun, which they put in a to-go box, as I knew I would not have room and they were happy to do that.  We also had the Popeye Omelet that had spinach and cheese a plenty, doing an up charge for the French Toast, which they fry.  If you like funnel cake, which is somewhat how they described it, which was completely accurate, you will love it.  If you like more traditional french toast, this may not be how you like it but it was a neat take on french toast.  I also cannot say enough about the service, it was laid back, friendly but still totally efficient and attentive.  It was great.  Go here, you will not be disappointed.  As others have stated it is CASH ONLY, so go prepared but they do have an ATM to access should you forget.",2018-02-24 15:56:14

89,24,3.0,"I remember coming to the Buffet at the Bellagio several years ago for Sunday Champagne Brunch and being blown away.   It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.  

Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.

As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  

Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.

My husband loves the Dutch baby pancake - not many places have them and you have to allow for 30 minutes for it to cook, but it's delicious. I've had eggs and sausage: the eggs are light and fluffy and very good. The sausage is good too, and the hash browns are fresh and more like thinly sliced fried potatoes than a grated potato square you might get other places. I've also had the blueberry pancakes - so addictive and I appreciate that the blueberries are in the compote as well as inside the batter. The Buffalo chicken wrap that I tried yesterday was the best I've ever had. The wrap/tortilla was fresh and not too thick; the lettuce, tomato and cheese were all fresh, and the chicken was flavorful and seasoned just right with the hot sauce. Usually the hot sauce is poured in and drops out when you eat it, but this one had the hot sauce applied to the chicken before it was added to the wrap, which makes for a much cleaner and more welcome eating experience.

1214,31,2.0,"Probably the WORST buffet in Las Vegas. This place makes the already not-so-great, Vegas buffet in Glendale, CA. look good.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafood-buffet-glendale#hrid:JnIwxV7PDcIRU7PhAETMrA) 

I bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is. 

The line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.

When you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees? 

I barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies. 

I will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again.",2012-06-26 19:10:08

1156,61,1.0,"I'm sorry to have to do this, but the owner of this place is a jerk.  I got yelled at, for playing pinball in a way that has helped me play very well in pinball tournaments and leagues over the years, and not one time has anyone, including the owners of some very rare and valuable games, mentioned anything to me about abusing a machine.  But that wasn't the case here at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  Instead, I was told (in a very confrontational way) that new Stern machines were all made of plastic, the flipper buttons (of course), the sides (huh?) and the legs (did he really just say that?!?) and that I better calm down or I would be asked to leave.  BULL$HIT.  He treated me like a moron--flat out lied to me thinking I must not know any better.  This was after he stood about 5 feet away from me with his arms crossed watching very disapprovingly as I would hit the side of an Avatar machine to keep the ball from exiting the right orbit and dropping into the right sling.  Watch just about any pinball video or tutorial and it's pretty clear this is the sorta thing you have to do to control the ball and continue playing.  It also does absolutely nothing to harm the game, and hitting the side with a sledgehammer certainly wouldn't have caused a pop bumper to be non-functional, or the one-way gate at the top of the left orbit to be jammed up, as they were on this particular machine.  It also wouldn't have caused AC/DC to be about 5 degrees off level.  And to make matters worse, I never encountered a tilt warning on AC/DC, Avatar, or the one EM I played before I was warned for a second time for making a very light slap save.

I would think that Mr. Tim Arnold, of such long standing participation in the world of pinball operation, maintenance and collecting would know how to set a tilt bob to prevent players from being able to move the game in the slightest, since that's apparently what he wants. I can now only assume that's much too difficult a task, and it doesn't give him an opportunity to eject people that obviously know what the hell they're doing on a pinball machine, and that might otherwise complain about the poor operational condition of most of the games in his establishment.  I chose to leave on my own after the second warning during which time I was followed out the door while continuing to be berated.  I have no desire to ever go back and give this guy another quarter, so he can flip it all to the Salvation Army (400k last year) while continuing to let his games sit broken and refusing help from volunteers to get them repaired in a reasonable time frame.  You'd think he could take some of that money and invest it back into the place but I guess that's now how he wants to do business.  It keeps the ""complainers"" away.",2012-09-10 20:55:22
940,8,5.0,"I seriously can not get enough of this place. Every time we go to Vegas I have to go here. What you get for the price is just awesome.  I don't know how they are not busier. Yea you can go to a lot of other places and pay twice the price and still not get as good of choices as you can here. 

You get bottomless mimosas, plus a wide variety of food. Theres crab, asian, mexican, bbq, pho, and almost anything else your heart desires. This time I brought a friend that is vegan and she was still able to eat like a queen.  The dessert station gets better and better every time we go there. The thing that is a little troublesome is that the plates are always too hot at the dessert station, so all my chocolate melts before I get it to the table. I also think having an Ice Cream station would be super cool too!

I am guessing they just didn't want to spend any time brushing him so they shaved him completely. They did exactly what we said NOT to do. When I picked him up, my son and I could not even recognize him. When the groomer saw my disappointment, she said ""we don't torture animals here"" - as if he had been neglected and not ever brushed. No groomer lady, he's very loved and very well cared for. You are just lazy in not wanting to spend a few extra minutes combing him out. It doesn't hurt the pup if you grab the hair behind the comb and pull it through a tangle - but you know that. And why didn't you call us before shaving him to get our permission?

1049,533,4.0,"We went in with no reservations (Wednesday night) and were seated within 15 mins. I ordered the house margarita - that never came until we finished our main course. The fried green tomatos are really tasty. Breaded in cornmeal then fresh crab meat is dressed on top. The sauce is a bit spicey with a kick after eating it. Bone in ribeye is excellent. Bobby Flay saved himself with his grilling skills. The steak was seasoned with a southwest spice flavor to it. It literally leaves spicey-ness into your mouth. Maybe that's why our waiter (Richard) waited (I actually had to reminde him twice) for my house margarita...which I had to pay for.

Would have been given 5 stars had our waiter visited us besides taking our order and giving us our check.  He almost single handedly ruined my fried green tomato experience.",2009-12-08 17:39:40

My rescue pup is a friendly bundle of energy - but she pulled on walks, barked all night because she wanted to play, and didn't listen to a thing. She ran the house and I knew it. After just 4 weeks with Bob she walks on my side, listens to my commands, and I sleep through the night with zero barking. The off leash class was a life saver and has made our owner/dog relationship even better. Thanks Bob!",2017-08-13 23:25:32

I've only tried their chicken options and they are absolutely delicious. The chicken kabab it one of the best I've eaten in the US. They serve lentil soup in the beginning and I don't know why but they serve it with a piece of lemon to be squeezed so that the juice goes in it. It hardly makes a difference because the lemon-like taste disappears in the soup. Anyways, it still tastes good - high in protein content.

I don't give a damn about sanitation ratings of this place. In my opinion, this place could be just as filthy or clean as an American/Indian/Asian/Italian restaurant.",2015-11-26 19:27:43

The bathroom was amazing with a huge tub, glass shower, two sinks, and LCD TV.  Oh yea, and of couse there is the toilet.  Durr.  The layout of the suite is perfect.  You walk in and there are two SUPER comfy beds with a big flat screen.  A few steps below is another section with a huge L shaped couch and another TV.  I also loved how you have a remote to draw the curtains and shades.  This is KEY when you are hungover in the morning and can't seem to get up.  One press of the button and the 11am sunlight streams into your bedroom and you can't help but wake up. :)

799,35,5.0,"It was my first time in Vegas and let me just say, the Venetian was such a beautiful hotel to stay at. 

Firstly, the lobby is beautiful with the high ceilings with beautiful Grecian styled paintings. The front desk attendants were all very kind and patient. They even gave us an upgrade. We got a room with a view of the pools! After walking through the casino to get to the room towers (which wasn't too far nor was it difficult to navigate), we headed up to our magnificent room.
It was spacious, clean, and so gorgeous. I really like the theme of the Venetian, makes you feel like royalty! The bathroom is the first door when you walk in and it was huge. Separate shower and bath. Great vanity space which also had a light up desk mirror in addition to the double sink. 

The room itself was also very spacious. Giant king bed that was so comfortable. With extra living space with sofa with a pull out bed. The two T.Vs were on the smaller side but we didn't spend much time in our rooms lounging so they weren't a huge issue. The mini bar was expensive but there were multiple Walgreen's close by so we didn't purchase anything from it!

The service was impeccable. We didn't have the room cleaned everyday but when we needed it to be cleaned, we would call down and leave the room for an hour or two for a meal and it would be quickly cleaned by the time we were back. 

The pools are also really big and lots of chairs available. There's little to no kids and there's even an adults only pool! 

The food options are pretty decent. There's a couple of late night spots opened as well. Most of the time we wandered off the strip to try new things but there is definitely a variety available in the Venetian. 

I have no complaints about this hotel. Great service and amazing rooms.",2017-07-28 19:05:39

All three of us order the hashbrowns and all three of us were very disappointed.  The hashbrowns were soggy, lukewarm, and almost the consistency of mashed potatoes in the middle.  Yuck!  My easy over eggs still had runny whites all around the yolk... double yuck!!  The only saving grace was the yummy bacon.  The food certainly wasn't worth waiting in line to get in the joint.

My only complaint is the service, and it's only one barista in particular.  We get great service from everyone else.  Much like one of the reviewers below, we have had this barista just stare at us when come up to the counter with a strange look on her face, and she says nothing.  I decided to just start ordering when the strange look turned into a nasty looking smirk.  I've asked her about some of the food on previous visits, if she had eaten it, and she made another strange face and said, ""Uh, no.""  This barista really creates a terrible vibe for our visits, and seems very unfriendly and rude.

My favorite Cirque show for a variety of skill and acrobatics is Mystere.  Ka had more of a story, some acorbatics and a great giant floating stage, Oh involved a lot of water with acrobats diving into the pool. All the shows I mentioned the music was forgettable cirque gibberish.  The music is the star of the Love show and since both my kids like the Beatles it was money well spent. The staging lighting, sound was impressive  and it all correlated to the song.  If you are not a big  Beatles fan I'd stay away.  I can understand why some are disappointed as I too thought it could use more jaw dropping acrobatics.  I kept waiting for some of the performers bouncing around on bungees to do something but they never did.  I was thinkning 'heck I can do that!'

New Years I had a table on the dance floor. The place was so packed with drunk guys. We had 2 bottles knocked off the table by drunk people. We had so much alcohol that I didn't really even care. The biggest problem was the lack of security which allowed for creepy guys to bump into and knock over the girls with me. We left at like 1:30 which is really early in vegas. That's how bad it was.

The little guy working the front needs to get a clue. He yells at his own staff in front of customers. I can't even begin to explain how bad this makes your club look. Everyone is pissed off and stressed out which trickles down to the customer. LAVO check your cameras on this guy.

Anyhow...go somewhere that actually takes care of their customers.  Lavo has too much of an ego for what it is. The girls always clear out and go somewhere else at 2am too. I'm never going back to this place.",2010-04-10 19:14:56

There weren't too many people in line it's just that there isn't even enough room at the check in desk to hold enough employees to check us in. I'm sure this is because this hotel was originally built to be a condo. I think that has led to many of the cons I have about this hotel. The lobby was also hot the whole time we stayed at the hotel. Usually hotels are pretty cold. 

My bf and I were staying at Vdara for a romantic getaway. You would think that a nice quiet hotel would be good for us, but it was just tooo quiet! It was also difficult staying there because they had only one restaurant and it was only open for breakfast and lunch. I've heard it's closed since then. I'm not sure if there is anything there now. The hotel is also so far from everything. It even felt far just to get to Aria. 

Our hotel and room were nice and clean. Everything had a modern look to it, but for being a nice hotel, the furnishings seemed kinda chintzy like I could easily break it by accident. It was also really weird that there was a kitchenette but no utensils or dishes to use. We got a crazy, good deal on the hotel, but for the normal price I don't think it would be worth it. 

We wanted to go in the pool because the news about the death ray the hotel bldg creates on their pool, but didn't get to. I heard they had fixed it somehow. The staff was helpful and nice. Vdara isn't a bad hotel, but it's just not for me.",2011-10-01 05:20:53

The inside of the restaurant is small and intimate. We ordered the above because 1) we were hungry and 2) when would we ever be back anyways? The gyozas were juicy and the pork belly was delish. Reminded me of a beef bowl from Yoshinoya, but 100x better! The ramen was definitely a winner. In my boyfriends words ""the best ramen he's ever had.""

Where Salty's excels is the outdoor and open air seating in a cool part of town. Even on hot days misters keeps things cool.  Coupled with a good house Margarita, cold beer and good music it's easy to get swept up in an afternoon or evening of relaxed drinking with a few friends. There always seems to be some sort of discounted drink or food special.  Baseballs spring training brings even more specials.

Service is typically good and if sitting at the bar better than average.  At first glance Salty Senorita's is the type of place I avoid. Yet I usually find myself enjoy stopping in. My advice is to have dinner somewhere else, then stop in for a few drinks.",2012-03-19 21:34:13

1507,248,3.0,"Out with my kids and decided to get some late breakfast this morning. I've seen Waffles Cafe before and been curious about the food/concept. Our experience was pretty mixed. Cons: menu is confusing and ""building your own combo"" takes a hot minute to figure out. Are we in a Boba place or a milkshake place or a Waffle place? Are we better at breakfast or lunch? Slightly confusing.  Bathroom is dingy, maybe just unkept?, and waffle wasn't hot when served (butter-didn't-melt unhot). Brand feels a little confused somewhere between fast food and mom and pop diner. Fancy waffle around $7-$9 (for just the waffle). Syrup was thin and sweet, not very maple-y, as I had hoped for a waffle place. If you just order a simple waffle with syrup, I think you'd be disappointed. Pros: fruit bowl came with fresh mangos, pineapples and blueberries (amazing fruit bowl). Sandwiches and kids meal come with side/drink. ""Coffee bar"" and hot sauce bar had nice assortment. Most enjoyable was A.J. She greeted us, took our order and was incredibly friendly and informative. She saved our experience, which dependent on the food/cost, wasn't overly impressive.  We ordered mostly breakfast items and if we were to return might try the lunch/brunch items. I have a feeling those might be stronger than the breakfast items we ordered.",2018-05-03 04:24:07
1250,142,2.0,"So I really don't want to give this place two stars b/c this really doesn't reflect the food, but I have to b/c the service is sooooo slow! 

We had made a reservation for 9 and got there around 8:30 and they were able to seat us after about 10 minutes. Our waitress came over pretty quickly after we sat down but then it just went downhill from there. We had ordered drinks and the waitress brought my friend the wrong beer. We then ordered edamame and a bunch of sushi cut rolls, We were really hungry b/c we had just traveled to Vegas and went straight to dinner from the airport. We ordered the spicy tuna, salmon avocado, shrimp tempura and spicy scallop rolls. It then took about 45 mins. to get our rolls and we were starving! We ate those rolls pretty fast once they got to the table. We were still hungry, so for some reason we thought it would be a good idea to get some more rolls. Bad idea. The next set of sushi rolls took another hour. We almost wanted to cancel the order b/c it was taking so long. We were hungry but also tired and just wanted to get out of there. 

After we finally got the second set of sushi rolls, we immediately asked for our bill b/c we knew that would take a while, which we were right about. 

After about another 20 minutes, we were able to pay our bill and leave. 

As far as the sushi goes, it was really good. Our favorite was the shrimp tempura. Our least favorites were the spicy scallop and tuna b/c they were not spicy. 

The whole meal lasted almost 2.5 hours, which is pretty ridiculous. Not sure if I would go back b/c I don't think I have the patience.",2011-01-11 02:56:14

I had some type of lamb panini that was excellent, but not so much that I bothered to remember what it was called. I mean, whatever - I came to Las Vegas to drink and take pictures of myself to whore on to Facebook. Eating is secondary. (I kid, I kid!)

The clams were fantastic, and it's something that my friends and I still talk about to this day.

In truth, Spago deserves 4 stars, but our waiter drove me NUTS! He lingered at our table to flirt with one of my friends for what seemed like 15 minutes (and this guy must be sick, because my friend looks like she's 12!). I desperately wanted him to leave so I could devour my sandwich in the most unladylike manner.

141,94,2.0,"When it comes to the usual Costco deals and weekly road shows, this Costco is fine, but there are two big problems with this store:

1. In the last few months, the sample severs have gotten increasingly cranky and sometimes outright hostile. They have always been rude to my kids, who are generally polite, but today takes the cake. The server CHEWED out my son for touching one sample, then the other. Normally, that would be bad beahvior, but these were fully wrapped chocolates, not some greasy fish stick. The guy -- who was working the CHRISTMAS SECTION --  was so mad, I had to tell my son not to worry about it as we quickly walked away.

About half of the servers at this store are polite enough, but NONE of them EVER SMILE.

2. Even worse than the servers are the patrons, who are horrid creatures reminiscent of goblins from the Hobbit. Here are some examples:

*One time, two elderly women started swearing at each other as they fought for the parking spot I was trying to vacate. One woman, whose husband was driving in circles on the opposite side of the parking lot, literally stood in the spot I left while the other tried to run her over. I wish I was exaggerating, but I had to roll up my windows so the kids couldn't here the exchange of swear words. 

*My kids have been shoved out of the way of samples as if they have no right to be there.

*My kids have been rammed with carts by impatient shoppers who don't seem to understand that youngsters can get disorientated by the frenetic nature of that particular store. Heck, the traffic jams near the ready-to-eat chicken area can run 10-15 carts deep.

*I've had customers literally push us out of the way to lay claim to some product or another.

The staff is okay at this store, which I've frequented since 2008, but they don't work as hard at being friendly or helpful compared with other stores I've visited. I don't know what, if anything, they can do about the bad customers, but it seems they should at least be aware that the Scottsdale store is out of control.",2014-10-11 05:12:18

360,352,2.0,"The Good:
The casino is visually impressive, no doubt.  The circular layout reminds me of the Hard Rock in Las Vegas, only bigger.  Nice selection of good places to eat, as mentioned in Luckie's review.  Lot's of TV's, although the only channels being shown were ESPN (is there a reason they don't have the sports packages like a sports bar would have, such as NBA and NHL??).  There is a newer electronic roulette table that the old casino did not have, although it only seated 10 people or so.  We were there tonight (a Tuesday) and there were plenty of open slot and video poker machines to play at.  

The Bad:
We are low stakes players.  I enjoy $5 blackjack and the wife enjoys $5 three-card poker.  NO $5 minimum tables on a WEEK-night.  Everything $10 minimum.   The majority of tables were half full or empty.  I'm no math major, but it seems a full $5 table would bring in more rake than an empty $10 one.  We asked the dealer at the empty 3-card table about this and he flagged over the pit supervisor.  Both were friendly, but confessed they did not work at the old location and had no idea they had $5 minimum tables in the past.  The beers were $5 apiece at the bar.  

Summary:
The former Wild Horse Pass definitely catered to the working class, casual player.  The inexpensive, yet tasty, food grill that served a nice variety of foods has been replaced with the Boar Head Deli and Fatburger.  No more buffet.  Five dollar minimum tables gone.  This casino is definitely targeting the higher end, luxury players.  If you're looking to drop $5 a beer, a few hundred dollars at the tables and $100 on a steak dinner, this is your place.  As for us, we'll be driving the extra 20-minutes to Harrah's.",2009-11-04 04:02:06

There was a wait for outside dining at 11:30am but we got a nice seat inside where she could look out at the strip and I could watch sports on TV.

A big fan of TV cooking she told me I had to get the Motley Que pulled pork sandwich.  Please remember when looking at the menu that they call chips the British way (they really are fries) which confused me at first since he lives in Northern California.  Not wanting to load up too much, had a Greek Salad and water.  The drinks looked amazing, but being the responsible parent I drank an Arnold Palmer.

Our server, Nichole, was very attentive and got our order right away and refilled my drink 3 times before we left. Sounds trivial, but many times I've had Arnold Palmer refills be just iced tea or lemonade.

The sandwich was amazing and I have to say we were quite surprised at the generous and tasty Greek Salad.  The pulled pork was both crispy and tender and the donkey sauce was nice and sweet.

Prices were quite reasonable.  We also caught a glimpse of the Trash Can Nachos.  They were huge!  That is definitely an appetizer for 5-6 people.  The two people who ordered it barely ate a third and encouraged others to eat it!",2017-04-08 00:29:47

Spilled a ton of kimchi on myself, and our waiter was on the spot to get me some soda water and help me clean it out of my shirt.  Super funny guy and very nice.

The food was also amazing, but is not what you may expect.  It tasted and felt way healthier than what you may think when you think about bbq.  A very nice balance of flavors, and the amount of sides to put with the cooked meat and lettuce is wide in range.  Sure it was a bit pricey since my gf only eats at the most chicken, no beef, but if you go with a group it would seem more cost effective.

Some good things to know before you check in: they will want to authorize $150 per day you stay on your credit card for incidentals (its Vegas - no matter where you are they want to charge you for everything). XS, Surrender and various other bars and amazing restaurants are available to you within quick walking distance. I enjoyed the Society Cafe for breakfast and Switch restaurant for dinner. The pools are lovely and you have a quite a few options to chose from! The Fashion Show Mall is right across the street if Louis V, Channel, Hermes and Manolo are not on your agenda.

Quick tip - for great pizza, ambiance and a good deal, go to the Wynn down the long hallway past all the shops where you will find the Pizza Place - it even has outdoor seating next to a waterfall!

Today is my 11th wedding anniversary, and my amazing wife suggested we try LMB for our anniversary celebration.  Am I the luckiest guy in the world or what?

Ok, the line sucks.  The parking sucks.  Doesn't matter.  One taste of the food and all that stuff melts away like the glistening hunks of delicious brisket melts in your mouth.

We tried the fatty brisket, pulled pork, sausage, pork ribs, and the daily special beef short ribs on the bone.  For sides, we got the beans, grits (amazing), and potato salad.  

All of the meats are wonderful, perfectly smoked with a peppery bark.  The beef rib was remarkably unctuous and flavorful.  The fatty brisket though.  Damn.  It's succulent, incredible, simply the best piece of BBQ I've ever experienced.  I literally am starting to drool as I write this review and am reminiscing on the brisket.

Oh...and here is a good tip...get the pickles.  They are fantastic and and provide a perfect sharp crispy cold counterpoint to the glorious meat candy.

The price is not cheap.  Doesn't matter.  They are using only prime meat and you can instantly tell the difference.  Their product is worth the premium.

Also, I can't forget about the good folks who run this joint.  Everyone we encountered was so nice and wore their passion for the BBQ proudly on their sleeves.  Special kudos to the older gentleman who was expertly orchestrating the parking lot & told us all about what to try and some of the history while we were in line, and also the guy working the smokers.  He invited my wife back to show her the process he uses with the brisket, what an awesome treat!

Ok, I've gone on long enough.  A gold star for you if you're still actually reading this far down in the review.  Why are you still reading this?  Get in your car & head downtown to LMB.  The line is already forming, hurry!",2016-01-30 04:01:36

She asked for the discount and the girl working there said that she couldn't have it. She also said that it wasn't possible to give the discount, that everything was already set up in the system. From previous visits I know that this is not the case. So #1, they wouldn't do a tiny little thing for what I'm certain is one of their best customers. And #2, lie about your ability to do so.

As awesome as the ambience is, let's get down (no pun intended) to the real reason this place is a must in spending time in Vegas. The food is great. Wide selection, huge portions (A-muuuur-ri-cuh), and ridiculous affordable prices.

I wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in Mirage and hungry, I'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon. I wouldn't spend full retail price eating there. Other buffets on the strip are better for same price points.",2014-09-09 19:15:26

1701,515,3.0,"Five stars for Kaskade. One for the club itself or should I say for the people in the club? Three for the establishment, itself.

What is there to say about dayclub? 

Other than the fact that women who would be scandalously dressed up in evening attire would be jumping up and down in barely there bathing suits in broad daylight.

Everything is the same as it would be during the night. The only difference being is they will make you take the stairs from hell to get to the top floor(seriously, can't you just let everyone use the elevator?!). Is this what you do to people who buy tickets in advance so they can be less accommodated? 

Fortunately for you Marquee, I am willing to set those thoughts aside to see my man Kaskade open up dayclub for 2014.  Overall, Kaskade's set was amazing(as to be expected). Whatever happened to that supposed outdoor dome they kept advertising about? I saw nothing of the sort there. I would say the only downside about going to the day club is being doused by pool water from the people in the pool and random people throwing drinks in the air(I swear if I could hit people with the 'stupid' stick, I would).That's one of reasons I wouldn't want to come back.

1021,352,2.0,"2.5-Stars is more than fair! But I am rounding down for this place. 

Had a night here and at first glance it's a pretty good looking place to stay. The decor is fresh, modern, and very tasteful. 

Kinda like a desert mirage it was all just in my imagination...

The check-in experience was very disappointing as they seemed confused on just about everything and how to process our stay. One manager was on a call with an angry guest-- that was clue #1. 

Besides the to be expected rank odor of stale cigarettes throughout the place, what I noticed almost immediately was the low grade materials and workmanship everywhere!!! 

The paper-thin walls are no joke! You can hear everything near, above, and below. Every voice, cough, grunt, and sound will be magnified in all directions. 

Then if you turn the A\C on in the room it will sound much like a freight train passing by...

While I am grateful there was a mattress cover on the bed, it felt like a heavy weight plastic bag used in a geriatric facility. Nothing like rolling over on plastic. 

Loved the style of the bathroom just wish the water pressure matched the strength of the design. 

Here's what I would leave you to consider-- it's cheap and fairly nice, just not as nice as it looks!! If you go to a Motel 6, you know exactly what to expect, however when you come here you may be dissatisfied once you realize everything you see is just too good to be true! 

If you're drunk and exhausted, you won't even notice the noise or cheap construction...

Stay at your own risk, just beware every sound and noise you make will be heard and noted by all of your neighbors.",2015-01-04 23:15:13

801,123,5.0,"I only knew this was the best salon when I was lured away by a chichi North Scottsdale salon that had all the bells and whistles, except my almost-to-the-length-I-wanted hair and nearly shoulder-length bangs now became an homage to Jennifer Anniston (circa Friends do). I wanted to speed to SnapDragon and beg their forgiveness for cheating. 

Flash forward a few months and my thick, ethnic, wavy (just plain difficult) hair grew back enough to be ready for a fix. Sure enough, Michaela worked her magic. The layers are blended and virtually disappear into one another rather than remaining like a tiered cake.

Yes, their prices are a bit higher than other salons, but you get what you pay for. What is a few extra dollars spread out over a few months? I'll skip a Starbucks or two to have my hair looking nice every day for months!!!

ONLY other drawback is limited parking.

I echo many other reviews; owner Kandi (sp?) and Jenny are amazing with cut and color in every circumstance. Both perfectionists and always speaking the truth; if they don't think your hair is the type that will hold that color or be right for that cut, they'll tell you!

If they maintain the service my friends and I received this last visit, this restaurant will be unstoppable.  This place is well priced for the product they provide!

Our server, Amy, was perfect.  She was pleasant, attentive and knowledgeable.  My friend is particular about his drinks and she answered all his questions- no problem.  My Moscow Mule was excellent.  She did proper follow ups with all of us if we wanted refills on our drinks.  We took a bit of time to pick our entrees because we were talking, and that was no problem.  She came back in timely intervals to see if we were ready to order.  She would walk by, check the table, and she could tell if everything was as it should be- so didn't feel the need to interrupt and ask.  There was a young man that kept our water topped off.

Our friends arrived before we did, and they were sensitive to another guest that smelled like the marlboro man himself- the owner gladly accommodated, reseating them in a booth between the bar and the trendy modern Japanese mural wall.  A nice conversation piece for the fans of modern Japanese culture and nerds alike.

Starters: Charred edamame, Ebiyaki, and Stellar Chips.  Easy to share amongst us.  
Cocktails: Moscow Mule, Apple Blossom x2, Sake (on tap).  
Entrees: Cedar Plank Salmon on Forbidden Rice, Sunshine Sushi Roll, Foo Burger, Crispy Rice Delight
Dessert: The Funkler (A nice finish on the meal)

Everything was properly seasoned, delicious, not over the top- per usual!  The food has always been creative and well prepared.  This visit just maintains that reputation with us.  Our friends loved it.  All of our plates left the table clean.  Doesn't matter if it comes from the kitchen or the sushi bar, it's very enjoyable.

The ambiance/environment is trendy, modern Japanese with chill upbeat music playing and martial arts films w/ subtitles playing silently on a few screens.  It just feels good to be in this space.  Very relaxed and comfortable. Balanced lighting.  A nice space to have some great conversation with some friends.

This restaurant use to struggle with service, but have always been on point with environment and food.  They really took the extra steps to move this in the right direction, and I'm pleased for it.  We'll be back again with more friends.

I was charged a rate, in which my friend argued with them and they removed the charge.  

Now it should be a 3 star hotel

I have stayed at the Venetian back in 2010 and it was not well taken care of. For better rooms, you would need to stay in the Venezia or the Palazzo.

I had been putting off visiting because I had heard such positive things about UNA,... yes it's strange but the more great things I hear about a restaurant the higher my expectations and the greater the possibility to disappoint. Remember Platoon?

UNA was all that it was cracked up to be. A wonderful setting, nicely laid-out dinning area with several small tables, a few larger ones, and a good sized bar area. We were seated quickly, the staff was attentive, and despite the busy lunch hour we felt well looked-after.

Onto the food! If you're at UNA it's for the the pizza. And if you want a good test for a proper pizza napoletana, pick up a slice and hold it out in front of you. The crust should not flop, bend or otherwise sag. Now bite, it should be crisp on the bottom, lightly sauced, and not weighed down with excessive toppings and cheese. 

Bottom line, UNA has the best pizza napoletana that I have tried outside of Italy. Do yourself a favour and get there early for lunch on a sunny day.",2012-03-21 14:11:44

Why only 4 stars? The line (even for cabana reservations) was long and they definitely overbooked. We had a large group and had several things set up - a table, a lilypad, and an upstairs cabana and service was good, but not impeccable (and it should be for the prices you're paying!).

The table was comfy and was a good place to store your bags and shoes and you could order both food and drink. The Lilypad was a great place to be in and out of the pool at the same time .... but you can't order food or store your stuff (so luckily we had both the Lilypad and the table!). Service at both was good - but our hostess was definitely overbooked and it was hard to track her down.

The cabana service was top notch .... unfortunately, you can't be in the pool and the cabana at the same time which I think is good if your group is older and wants to stay away from the mess, but all we wanted to do was dance in the pool. For the price of a cabana, I think it should have some easy pool access (or some sort of mini pool, like Liquid Lounge) to tie the whole thing together.

Overall, it was a great pool party - our various hostesses were really sweet despite the crowd and we had an amazingly fun day.

I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.

When you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! 

Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!

Do yourself a favor, plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom, have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit, then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires!

1058,572,3.0,I have a Sprinkles in my area but I decided to try out this shop too and see how it would compare. The shop is located at the Linq with a couple outdoor seats. The line was out of the door for a Thursday night so try not to come during peak hours! It's still overhyped in my opinion but I didn't even know they had an ice cream shop. I ended up getting the cookie dough which was delicious but a little sweet for my palate. The service was friendly but on the slower side. They even have a cupcake ATM too but I'll come back next time to try it!,2017-02-14 07:48:44

My rescue pup is a friendly bundle of energy - but she pulled on walks, barked all night because she wanted to play, and didn't listen to a thing. She ran the house and I knew it. After just 4 weeks with Bob she walks on my side, listens to my commands, and I sleep through the night with zero barking. The off leash class was a life saver and has made our owner/dog relationship even better. Thanks Bob!",2017-08-13 23:25:32

1393,281,5.0,"Chef Christopher is not unlike a character crafted by (insert prolific author here). I wouldn't be surprised if his motto wasn't ""if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself."" Undoubtedly, he would wash dishes and bus tables if he could. The fact that he cannot control every second of the customer's experience is visibly painful.

The night's main course was salmon or chicken. Crippled by indecision, I finally landed on the boneless, skinless chicken, with a smear of asiago cheese, basil and garlic rolled in prosciutto. This coiled beauty lay napping in a pool of fresh corn polenta with aromatic tomato basil fennel sauce.

Cafe Monarch truly takes comfort food to the next level. My first bite was akin to stepping into a warm bath. Even the tap water tasted like home; a farm that I never grew up on. Truly honest, rustic food.

No visit to Cafe Monarch would be complete without a little chat from the Chef. He personally thanks every one of his customers for coming in and tucks away their comments and feedback for later analysis. The conversations are never disingenuous, but always intriguing. In between tiny sips of hibiscus tea from what appears to be a squat ceramic container that you store kitchen utensils in, he is quietly studying you and plotting his next meal.",2012-04-18 02:14:05

I decided not to order my usual 5-spot breakfast sandwich and had the Hog & Chick menu item for a change.  I ordered my eggs over easy and hashbrowns, instead of the country potatoes.  All three of us order the hashbrowns and all three of us were very disappointed.  The hashbrowns were soggy, lukewarm, and almost the consistency of mashed potatoes in the middle.  Yuck!  My easy over eggs still had runny whites all around the yolk... double yuck!!  The only saving grace was the yummy bacon.  The food certainly wasn't worth waiting in line to get in the joint.  If we go back, I would stick with the 5-spot breakfast sandwich and the country potatoes.",2016-12-27 20:57:01

I was in the area so I decided to make a trip there. I picked up a large rib platter to go with corn bread and mac n' cheese and banana pudding as my sides. They didn't put excessive amounts of sauce on the ribs but provided an extra container of sauce, which I prefer. I'm also not a big melted cheese fan, but their mac n' cheese has the perfect amount of cheese. And the banana pudding was great too. I don't live super close to Moe's, but it was definitely worth the trip. I'll be back and will recommend to others!",2016-07-28 02:00:13

As a table of four, we started off with the Guy-Talian Fondue Dippers and Fireball Whiskey Wings. The cheese that came with the dippers was phenomenal, and we saved the leftovers for our fries later on during our mean! The wings were amazing but were definitely spicy. Didn't taste like cinnamon though, which I was happy about! We skipped the Greens, because lets get real, this isn't a place for healthy eating! We had the Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger, which was also a delicious option. We shared the brisket sandwich, which I didn't try, but my boyfriend said it was amazing but had a bit too much sauce. 

To top off our extremely greasy meal, we got the Triple Doublemint Pie. YUM! I was kind of bummed there was only one oreo on there and two or three junior mints, but it was still delicious. Definitely enough ice cream to share with 6 people!

992,90,5.0,"This place is a GREAT alternative to Tacos El Gordo. In fact, I think this place is much better than Tacos El Gordo. First, the actual venue is very nice. It is very clean, open and hip. I love how they have a line to separate the different meats you want in your tacos/burritos/quesadillas.  Closer to the cash register, is a bar and another line to order fries, nachos, corn, etc... 

The food is delicious but I've only had Carne Asada tacos and Carne Asada fries. I have yet to try the corn and other meats. I'm sure they all taste great as they look delicious on everyone else's plates. 

The venue also has a condiments area in the middle which is very very hearty with salsas, veggies and a few other fresh accompaniments to your food. 

Lastly, the staff is very nice. I especially love the lady that serves in the line where you order your sides and extras (fries, corn, nachos, etc...). She is amazing!",2017-09-09 15:42:32
15,49,5.0,"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.

I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.

I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 

They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.

Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed.

1605,629,4.0,"The culinary talent oozing out of the kitchen is highly commendable, the ambiance is equally pleasing to the eyes, the service, however, leaves a little something to be desired.  Still, when in Aria, I would recommend visiting Sage without fail.

Once you walk past the wine racks that line the entrance to the restaurant, a lounge/bar area serves as the holding area before you are seated in the cavernous dining room with blue-lit walls featuring sections of a painting by Seurat.  It's classy, yet modern, and delightfully decadent.

Most of our party ordered from the Signature tasting menu, which at $84 was a solid deal for 4 courses.  All dishes were wonderfully prepared with balanced flavors and artful presentation.  Although many opined on the foie gras creme brulee, I opted for the burrata, which was good, but it had me wishing I ordered the foie gras.  The dayboat scallops with oxtail was fantastic, perhaps my favorite dish of the evening.  The 24 hour cooked beef belly was wonderfully tender, reminiscent of braised pork belly, but not quite as fatty.  For dessert, the olive oil ice cream on my plate was my favorite part.  While I skipped the wine pairing, several people did and were quite pleased with the pairings.

Onto the service.  Oh, our server.  He was young and inexperienced.  He spent more time crossing the restaurant floor back and forth than coming by our table.  I can excuse inexperience, but the rest of the staff at our table seemed cold, one person in particular.  He would almost toss our place settings at our table and seemed like he really didn't care about being there that night.  It certainly didn't ruin the meal, but it was a shame to have the service mar an otherwise wonderful experience.",2012-09-18 16:19:22

413,220,3.0,"Grew up in this area and was back in town for a visit. Stopped to eat there and was totally disappointed.

The food stayed the same and the service and prices changed. 

15 wings/side curly fries (no sauces)/fried pickles/salad and 2 sodas -with minimal tip - $47!!

The wings were the best thing of the meal - the sodas were served in 12 oz Dixie cups loaded with ice! It was like 3 gulps and empty! 

The fries and fried pickles were so greasy! Bit into pickle and breading slid right off while grease poured out. Plus 6 pickle 1/4 - so like 1.5 pickle for  $7-8 (I think) So not worth it. 

Chicken salad - I think I paid  $9 for a head of lettuce and 5 small and I mean small pieces of chicken. I had better salads from a gas station pre-made.

The service - horrible! Food came out at different times - we asked for the fries and pickles to come together - pickles came out, 5 min later fries, within mins the salad and 5 min later the wings! 

First soda my BF order - the syrup was out! Ok that happens - took 5 mins to get another and the small glass to begin with was only 1/2 full! 

Totally disappointed! This place has moved to the bottom of our go to list!",2016-05-01 13:12:38

But, by the end of the first class, she was well on her way to being the well mannered but still friendly dog that we want.  This is an experience which involves a lot of owner time investment as well as the weekly training with the dog trainer.  If you are willing to put in the time and use the methods taught by Pat, the results are truly incredible. Although we could have our dog off-leash, I suggest that you keep your dog on-leash outside of a contained area for your dog's safety.",2018-03-18 17:57:25

The entrees also took a long time. After we were finished eating it was quite a while before our server came back to give us the check.

Riding an UBER to this location cost $39 uber xl
I really don't know how we ended up here because this was about 25 minutes or 11 miles away from the strip.  My only guess is that we needed a quiet place away from the craziness and needed a hometown feeling, this provided very well.

I expected this place to be tiny since everyone said it was a local casino.  I was wrong. This place was huge.  Once walking in, I felt a very nice Vibe.  A Live Band was playing some cool songs and the place just gave me a relaxed feeling which I needed.  The locals who I have met were wonderful.  The servers, the bartenders, the performers were very inviting.
In a matter of minutes, I too felt like a local since they treated me as such.  

There were relaxing seats all over the bar where I just plopped on down, listening to the music being played, people watching, having a nice beer or two or three or four, and just had my groove on.  People introduced themselves and we gave high fives to one another while saying cheers and long life as our beer bottles clanked as we toasted the night away.

I am very happy that I found this place.  I definitely look forward to coming back here and probably will stay at this hotel.  This place was refreshing.  After a hard days work, I can imagine sitting and drinking a few cold ones here and literally enjoying it. Thank You Sunset.

921,632,4.0,"WHY WE GO HERE:
- because when with Mexicans, we go Mexican

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- you know it's real when the line be poppin' and stretching well through the front entrance
- gated outdoor seating

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- beyond the multiple lines there is indoor seating to the right

THE MENU:
- tacos
- vampiro
- quesadillas
- sopes
- tostadas
- mulas
- [insert meat choice here] fries
- drinks
- meat choices: cabeza (beef head), lengua (beef tongue), tripa (tripe; stomach/intestines), suadero (thin cut of beef from the intermediate part of the cow between the belly and the leg), sesos (beef), buche (pork cheek), carne asada (grilled beef), chorizo, adobada (spicy marinated pork), al pastor (pork); NOTE THERE IS NO POLLO (CHICKEN) OPTIONS SERVED HERE

WHAT WE ORDER:
- tacos (adobada, al pastor, asada, buche, cabeza, lengua, tripa)
- fries (lengua)
- horchata (cinnamon rice water; liquid Cinnamon Toast Crunch for those unfamiliar with this)

HOW IT WORKS:
- depending on the menu item/meat choice you're going for, you have to go into separate lines accordingly; if you're in a group and you're smart about it just have different people in your group go into the different lines and then Venmo amount owed to one another
- after ordering your food, your food is given to you on the spot, and then you go to ANOTHER line in the far right corner in between the indoor seating and the outdoor seating to the cash register to pay for your food
NOTE: yes of course the workers here speak English, but I personally feel if you're with a Spanish speaker, AND you're nice, then the workers will try their best to help you get the other meat choices you're trying to order without having to go in the separate lines

THE TASTE:
- LENGUA IS MY LIFE! especially when it's made WELL; when we go here we usually will get lengua fries (because carne asada fries are basic) and lengua tacos
- I'm a BIG fan of their tacos here, but I will have to say that generally speaking I'm just not a fan of cabeza or buche, but hey, at least I can say I've tried it

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- the servers have always been pretty efficient and super nice
- security guard(s) onsite are nice too, unlike bouncers at clubs sometimes
- the cashiers can be pretty curt, but that's OK",2017-10-02 21:40:03

As far as it being a premium beer and burger joint, it was just ""Meh, I've experienced much better for me."" I arrived to downtown Pittsburgh on a Sunday evening  and it was DEAD. Tried to go out and get something to eat around 9:30p, and ended up Sharp Edge as everything else was closed down. 

I sat at the bar and was served by Scott, very aloof, unfriendly and he poured very weak cocktails. Not good. I ordered the bacon burger with cheese and sweet potato fries and it took about 40 minutes. Trust me, I am willing to wait for something worth waiting for but this meal was very average. I must say that the bun was fresh and toasted nicely, it had a great texture but everything else was pretty run of the mill. The fries were nothing special - just your standard sweet potato fries. 

Overall, not a great first ""Pittsburgh"" experience. We're headed to Tonic Grill or something like that -- hopefully it is a better representation of what Pittsburgh has to offer. Headed to Primanti Brothers tomorrow for their ""world famous"" sandwiches. I am actually excited about that trip as it was featured on Man vs Food.

394,69,2.0,"I've come here on previous visits, and was looking forward to the Fire Ball  Wings.  Unfortunately, they are no longer on the menu and were replaced with regular buffalo wings.   They were small and very average.  Providing a tasty dipping sauce with the wings doesn't compensate for small blah wings you could find anywhere.  We went back again 2 days later and tried the Trash Can Nachos.  Ours looked nowhere like the picture and was overloaded with a nasty tasting cheese that overpowered the entire dish.  I never thought I'd use the words 'too much cheese', but this was just nasty.  $20 Nachos should at least taste great. I'll upload a picture of them after posting this review.

Onto the good.....

We had Spicy Bloody Mary's on both visits.  Worth the $15 price each and huge. It's a little inconsistent on toppings, but nonetheless really good.

Service was a little slow on my first visit, but after seeing the Bloody Mary, I understood why It took a little longer, and I was fine with that.

The take.......

Bring those Fire Ball wings back.  Why would you even take something so good off the menu, only to replace them with something people can get anywhere?

Either revisit the Trashcan Nachos recipe, or revisit the staff that are making it.  Who would ever expect Nachos to be bad?  How do you screw that up?  That cheese is pungent nasty.",2018-06-19 15:58:52

First time here, so far mixed opinion. We were greeted, seated, and given both drinks and appetizers SUPER quickly by some extremely friendly staff. So that rocks. Great service is so hard to find these days. 

Now for the let downs. We ordered the Asian Sampler platter. Shrimp skewers, pot stickers, and chicken satay, two of each. First issue is that the portions were tiny. Like...bite sized. Small bite sized tiny. And at $13, it's like $2 a bite. So overpriced. Also under seasoned, pretty badly. We had to drown the food in sauce to taste much at all. So bummer. 

The pizza was mostly good. We had the garlic chicken, thin crust. The chicken was also a little under seasoned both in terms of salt and the garlic itself. Very little of both. But the thin crust was amazing, and the cheese...to die for. Like...I'd line my casket with it. Simply delicious.

On this trip I discovered a new favorite that I absolutely will find the recipes for....the chicken taco's.  Delicious rub on the skewers of grilled chicken, grilled achiote, fresh cilantro, and a peanut-barbecue sauce that simply makes it all sing.

I definitely recommend getting here as early as you can for breakfast, otherwise there is going to be a long wait.  But you know what, if there is a wait, I suggest you wait anyways the food it good! 

Ordered a BLT Mary and Corned Beef Hash, tasty!!  The bloody MAry was cute, they dressed it up and put the ""sandwich fixings"" on the side just like you could make a liquid sandwich.

249,413,3.0,"To start this review off, let me just say that I am not really a fan of buffets in vegas. I've never really preferred massive quantity for mediocre quality. That being said, I think Wicked Spoon is okay. We got there at 5PM on a saturday before the rush started, so you'll do yourself a favor if you get there early. We chose to go early because who likes to be full of food when they go out later that night? Not me. 

The food was pretty decent. I tried the truffled potatos, the shrimp miso, spinach salad, and a few other choice items. All in all, not that bad. I did like the fact that they were also plated separately, which made it easier and gave points for presentation. But, presentation doesn't make it for me entirely. Some of the stuff was also a bit overcooked. 

The dessert were also a big draw for me to these types of things, I tried one of each and didn't really find anything that stood out as well. It was all packaged wonderfully though (once again, points for presentation) but to be honest, the only thing I really liked was the chocolate covered strawberries and the Chocolate mousse/berry thing they had. The gelato was 'meh' since it tasted like the typical gelato stuff. 

All in all, not bad, but I probably wont be spending $37.50 + Tip for something like this again. I think although it is nice and everything, it is NOT WORTH $37.50, hence it is only Ok.",2011-08-04 15:58:06
1427,307,2.0,"I attended the free pizza on Tuesday.  It's a fantastic idea that
staff get a free practice, (potential) customers have a sample
and restaurants get free advertising and feedback.  I'd been craving pizza for ages and was excited to be able to create my own pizza on top of it. 

As a vegie lover, I asked the guy serving vegetables and may I add repeatedly asked him for one of each vegetable.  
They can do this action at Subway so what was wrong with 
this guy?  After every vegetable he stopped and gave the chintziest amount as possible if he chose to place some on.  

Anchovies were not placed on the pizza; not mine and not on my friend's.  Twice in a row they 
got it wrong.  Unlike me he complained so we had to wait longer and my pizza got cold waiting to dine with him.

The manager was rude and shouted at me rather than 
helped me get heard by deaf staff.  No, it was cold and not tasty and the way I got abused was for free.  

Service didn't happen nor did they meet their advertising for if you don't get what you ask for how can you build your own?  Were the manager civilized he 
would help me and I would be inclined to return.

848,621,5.0,"This review is a long time coming from me.  Only having lived in the Gilbert area for about 9 years, I have been able to see much of the old town grow into a more upscale, urban vibe to it that sort of meshes well with the dusty, tumbleweed blowing across the street scene that it is.  Confusing and sort of awesome all in one, the little old street in Gilbert has become a place of choice not only for me, but throngs of east valley residents as well.  There are too many good places to eat in this area and this is a good problem.  
The review:
Liberty has been a place I have been ordering take-out from for over two years now and my actual dine-in experience has been minimal. Parking is reasonable though can at times be difficult with Postino's, Joe's, and Oregano's all smashed together.  Phone-in orders are always courteous, almost always fully accurate with special order types, and the wait has never been prolonged.  The restaurant is clean and just fun to look at.  
Food is delicious.  I have not sampled the entire menu but it is varied and well thought out.  Pricey?  Maybe.  I have learned that more imaginative and fresh food equals a more premium price and for the most part, I accept this.  
As a creature of habit, I can speak on the salmon blt with authority; never fishy, good char on the bun, bacon is always delicious, tomatoes are thick and red.  Sandwiches are clever with designer cheese and excellent breads.  Homemade kettle-styled chips = yum!  
Breakfast is also varied and delicious.  
Coffee bar:  This is my favorite region of  Liberty.  I have shed the Starbucks addiction and moved to more local coffee houses that can replicate a good cappuccino.  Liberty can do this to my satisfaction.  The baristas are knowledgeable and friendly.  They will remember your order and chat with you if not too busy.  Adult coffee drinks?  Sign me up.  
I love this place.  I want to move in to this place.  I dislike people.  Herein lies the problem.  The times I can visit are always peak when there are throngs of 
obnoxious humans and the acoustics are terrible.  Navigating the Yukon models of strollers to a table is an exercise in patience and contortion; space between tables is at a premium.  
Is this a place to quietly work on your laptop with a cup of coffee? Depends on the time.  Is this a place to get an excellent coffee drink?  Yes.  Food is delicious and the atmosphere is engaging.  
Pros:  Food and coffee drinks; decor and yes, bathrooms have character.
Cons:  (Peak hours) Parking, too much humanity in one establishment, acoustics.

789,24,4.0,"I guess it's just as good as you'd expect! Tried the carving station, had a huge pile of crab legs, and a custom omelet. I have a bit of a gripe about the omelets...my fiance and I made it a point to get here before breakfast service ended precisely because I wanted to hit the omelet bar. We got in with about 30 minutes of breakfast service left, and when I got to the omelet station they were already breaking it down and getting ready for lunch. There was only the standard ""huge platter filled with scrambled eggs sitting over a sterno can."" I was annoyed...I complained ""I didn't pay all that money to eat pre-made eggs sitting under a heat lamp!"" Now, I'll give the guy credit...he said ""I'll make you whatever you want"" and so I still got my omelet! That was the right thing to do and I appreciated it. But it seems like I shouldn't have had to complain...most people wouldn't have said anything and would have just walked away disappointed. They should find a way to keep the station open right up until the end of the breakfast service.

Besides that, nothing but good things to say. I had a fantastic mimosa and made myself some sliders on rolls with the meats from the carving station, which were amazingly tender. The crab legs were the sweetest I've ever had...I think the snow crab was a little better than the king crab.

Great pastries. We had a sampling of them for dessert.",2012-04-28 17:04:57

1058,632,4.0,"My brother and I were hungry after eating a light dinner and it came to my attention that one of three Tacos El Gordo's in Vegas was located right down the road from our hotel. It's across the street from Encore and it gets a little sketchy but totally worth it! I came Wednesday over winter break, a little before midnight, and I was very surprised that there was minimal waiting. They have different lines so be prepared to split your group up to try all the meats. And don't be conservative with the amount of food you order here because the tacos are on the smaller side and you won't want to wait again in the line!

The guys that make your tacos are so quick and they cut the meat on the spot when you order. El Pastor is always my favorite and don't forget to order it with the pineapples and Carne Asada would come up us as a close second. My least favorite was the Chorizo because it was a little overdone and dry. I got a chance to try a couple Mulas but it does take awhile for them to make. I was too lazy to wait in the line again so next time, I'm going to try their Carne Asada fries. After you're done ordering, you go to the counter by the exit to pay. Tacos are a little over $2 bucks each, which isn't bad considering it's on the strip.

307,537,3.0,"I got this hotel for a great deal on priceline (less than 115 per night)

This was my first trip to Vegas, so not really familiar with much of the hotels but I had several friends staying in other places. At first I thought maybe our room was smaller than some of the other hotels like Paris and the Monte Carlo, etc but after visiting our friends rooms I realized ours was the same size.

If you are picky about ""ritzy"" rooms, or looking to spend a lot of time in your hotel and want everything literally at your fingertips, this isn't the place to go. The casino and pool are small and there's nothing terribly ""Vegas"" about this hotel. No shops, only one restaurant, one bar... it's very small scale. 

For us, it was great. We just hung out at other hotels to get the kitschy Vegas experience but still had a comfortable nice room to come back to that was half the price of other hotels and within walking distance of lots of Vegas hotspots. I'd say if you are looking for an affordable nice room and willing to go out of your hotel to experience Vegas this is a great choice. 

The staff was very helpful, valet was quick, check-in was MUCH faster than it was for my other friends staying in other hotels, and because there's not 3000 rooms in this place its easy to get to your room without having to wait for an elevator or navigate a maze.",2008-08-18 21:37:58
819,641,2.0,"The line to check took sooo long. I don't know what's up with that! There weren't too many people in line it's just that there isn't even enough room at the check in desk to hold enough employees to check us in. I'm sure this is because this hotel was originally built to be a condo. I think that has led to many of the cons I have about this hotel. The lobby was also hot the whole time we stayed at the hotel. Usually hotels are pretty cold. 

My bf and I were staying at Vdara for a romantic getaway. You would think that a nice quiet hotel would be good for us, but it was just tooo quiet! It was also difficult staying there because they had only one restaurant and it was only open for breakfast and lunch. I've heard it's closed since then. I'm not sure if there is anything there now. The hotel is also so far from everything. It even felt far just to get to Aria. 

Our hotel and room were nice and clean. Everything had a modern look to it, but for being a nice hotel, the furnishings seemed kinda chintzy like I could easily break it by accident. It was also really weird that there was a kitchenette but no utensils or dishes to use. We got a crazy, good deal on the hotel, but for the normal price I don't think it would be worth it. 

We wanted to go in the pool because the news about the death ray the hotel bldg creates on their pool, but didn't get to. I heard they had fixed it somehow. The staff was helpful and nice. Vdara isn't a bad hotel, but it's just not for me.",2011-10-01 05:20:53

876,193,5.0,"Wow. Wow Freakin' Wow.

I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER. 

I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.

I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.

When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!

The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.

We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.

But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.

Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.

For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.

Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) 

It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.

Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through. 

The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)

I loved staying here. Check in was fast; our room was ready at 11am. We had a partial lakeview on the 25th floor in the spa tower that had a great view of pretty much the whole fountain show and the strip. The room was updated, except for the tv, but I wasn't there to watch tv anyways. The bathroom was nice-stone counters and floors, seperate soaking tub and shower. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Loved the motorized blackout drapes; if only I could install them in our apartment.

The service was really great. Every employee we encountered asked if we needed something, especially room service. I enjoyed the casino a lot as well, it had a nice variety of slots and table games. 

Something we  were disappointed in was the selection of late night eating. They have the Cafe Bellagio, but it is sit down and at 3am you just want quick eats. Thank god for the 24 newstand shop and its selection of chips and candy...ok and selection of alcohol too.

If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.

We are paying $10.50 for mini wings and two sticks of carrots and two sticks of celery.  Never offered an alternative.  Not choice but eat the wings.  
I don't believe the restaurant is a good choice. Being in town square with so many good choices they are far from their competitors.  Never again.",2017-07-09 00:58:51

Our server was kind and checked in on us every once in awhile to see if everything was okay. It didn't take too long for the food to come out either for a place that was busy. Sadly I was on a budget that day so all I got were nutella crepes. Since it was my first time trying crepes I wasn't sure if there suppose to be cold? I still want to come back and try the other foods on the menu. One day I will!  Food can be pricey but that's basically like any other restaurant/cafe out there. If you love a sweet breakfast, this place has a lot of options for you! The staff is friendly as well so that's a bonus!

Only negative things I have to say about this place is that the tables are very close to one another. Almost as if I was eating with the family next to me haha. And the tables were too small. If there was more room/space in general, that would be great.",2016-02-09 03:23:18

They start you off with their mama's house bread and red sauce (I forgot what it's called but it's featured in my picture) and honestly, you don't really need an appetizer. Although, next time I would like to try their zucchini.

After I finished eating everything that was remotely visible vegetarian in site, I decided to take in a movie.

I went over to the Cineplex and saw the movie ""MUD"" starring Mathew Mcona(you know who he is, I cant spell his last name).The first matinee was $7.00 ,after that its more expensive I was told.The theater was standard and offered a middle aisle for people that have baby strollers I guess..or maybe the handicap.Lets just hope its not for people that want to bring their babies in a stroller in there!

Having all but abandoned planet starbucks, I have settled in to looking for amazing local coffee spots and Royal is easily among my favorite places.  Coffee is amazing.  All baristas are fully competent and fun to talk to, the music is always laid back, prices are reasonable and hardly any traffic.  This could be the downside.  Sadly, the Biltmore Union goes though more makeovers than most 40-50 year old Scottsdale cougars.  The Olive Mill closed, which served up delicious food and drinks, Frances retired back to their Camelback/Central location, and a few others that I can't recall the names but I frequented them until closed.  There has been live music in the past but I have not seen it as of late.  I realize my review is eulogizing the Union but if people continue to avoid this gem of a shopping location, Royal could be in jeopardy which in turn, would leave me very cranky.

Cory, one of the owners was kind enough to share the recipe with our group. I am going to attempt to make this at my holiday party. HOLY COW. It was fantastic. I also loved the deviled eggs (the pancetta and the caviar were a wonderful touch), the veal meatballs with  cream sauce, and the chicken skins with a yummy honey dip. We had several other wonderufl dishes but these particular ones stood out. My martini was made to perfection. The atmosphere of this place reminded me of places where I used to hang out in Seattle. VERY cool vibe, and VERY busy. We had great service and overall had a really nice evening.  I can't wait to go back and bring my friends.

795,322,1.0,"After reading reviews, we decided to finally try Avenue B as it had been on our list for quite some time. I have to say, I found everything about this place to be lackluster. We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can't think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It's possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I'm already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge. There are much better options in the city, both cheaper and better, and I will not be returning to Avenue B.",2017-03-15 01:57:34

We came for Sunday brunch, which is about $26 after tax. You can also get champagne for about $4 more. They had prime rib, leg of lamb, bacon, and turkey at the carving stations and an omelet station. The highlights for me, were the prime rib, Chilean sea bass (curiously mislabeled as Florida Wahoo), and the polenta.

The desserts we're also very good, but nothing really stood out for me.

Props also to our server who was very attentive during our 3 hour feeding frenzy.

I met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine. 

There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink. 

I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling. 

Customer service is VERY GOOD! They are all very helpful and fast, so please be ready to order!

1067,104,4.0,"My husband and I stayed here back in Feb. Was a little concerned with the mixed reviews. We got into Vegas around 8 on a Friday night. The valet was full but when we told them we were checking in they took our car anyways. Upon check in with a total rewards card you get to go to a separate desk so had a speedy check in. I was done before my husband was in from the valet. The front desk host was wonderful asked about the trip in and when I told her how I was a bit anxious about the room due to the yelp reviews she was kind enough to upgrade our room to the luv tub room. We stayed three nights and it was really affordable. Had a discounted rate through total rewards. The room was large and clean. The tub was huge it took about 2 min to fill. Great for a romantic weekend. They have a mirror over the tub and over the bed. Really my only complaint would be the fire alarm going off each day the first morning it was on our floor and around 9 am the second morning it was on a different floor and a bit later but still not fun. Took them a good 10 min to figure how to turn them off. Drink service was good on the  casino floor one person came by to take the order and about 5 min later someone else dropped off the drink. Still a lot of construction being done, can't wait to see it completed.  We will be going back again.

366,471,3.0,"I've been coming to Island Flavor ever since they opened and gave it a 5 star review on Yelp under the previous ownership. I ate there again today for the first time since the new owners made changes to the restaurant. 

First thing I noticed when I walked into the restaurant was the plain gray walls with no pictures on them. There were  3 TVs showing pictures of food. There was music playing but it was generic hawaiian music. Knowing the atmosphere of the previous ownership, the new decor seemed cold and generic. They got rid of the market and expanded the seating are which I felt was a plus.  

The food portions are noticeably smaller than the previous ownership and the new ownership seemed like it removed some items from the menu. I was disappointed as my daughter was told they didn't have any Hawaiian Sun POG.Hawaiian Sun is on the menu but I didn't know if they were all out or they didn't carry that flavor anymore. They were also out of Arizona Tea.  The quality of the food appears to be the same. 

I gave them 3 stars because Island Flavor seems to have lost some of the little things that made it feel like being back home in Hawaii and because of the noticeably smaller portions. Hopefully the food quality doesn't change because right now that is the only thing that has stayed the same from previous ownership. I want even going to try the Poke under the new ownership since the new owner couldn't pronounce it correctly in a video I watched after the new ownership introduced themselves.",2018-08-12 21:51:07

If they maintain the service my friends and I received this last visit, this restaurant will be unstoppable.  This place is well priced for the product they provide!

Our server, Amy, was perfect.  She was pleasant, attentive and knowledgeable.  My friend is particular about his drinks and she answered all his questions- no problem.  My Moscow Mule was excellent.  She did proper follow ups with all of us if we wanted refills on our drinks.  We took a bit of time to pick our entrees because we were talking, and that was no problem.  She came back in timely intervals to see if we were ready to order.  She would walk by, check the table, and she could tell if everything was as it should be- so didn't feel the need to interrupt and ask.  There was a young man that kept our water topped off.

Our friends arrived before we did, and they were sensitive to another guest that smelled like the marlboro man himself- the owner gladly accommodated, reseating them in a booth between the bar and the trendy modern Japanese mural wall.  A nice conversation piece for the fans of modern Japanese culture and nerds alike.

Starters: Charred edamame, Ebiyaki, and Stellar Chips.  Easy to share amongst us.  
Cocktails: Moscow Mule, Apple Blossom x2, Sake (on tap).  
Entrees: Cedar Plank Salmon on Forbidden Rice, Sunshine Sushi Roll, Foo Burger, Crispy Rice Delight
Dessert: The Funkler (A nice finish on the meal)

Everything was properly seasoned, delicious, not over the top- per usual!  The food has always been creative and well prepared.  This visit just maintains that reputation with us.  Our friends loved it.  All of our plates left the table clean.  Doesn't matter if it comes from the kitchen or the sushi bar, it's very enjoyable.

The ambiance/environment is trendy, modern Japanese with chill upbeat music playing and martial arts films w/ subtitles playing silently on a few screens.  It just feels good to be in this space.  Very relaxed and comfortable. Balanced lighting.  A nice space to have some great conversation with some friends.

This restaurant use to struggle with service, but have always been on point with environment and food.  They really took the extra steps to move this in the right direction, and I'm pleased for it.  We'll be back again with more friends.

We came for brunch, and as all girlie brunches start, we began with bellinis. Good sparkling wine with peach puree. It was brunch, but my like minded ladies wanted to try the oysters here and they were the quality kind, not too oversized and lacking that fishy flavor.

Then between us we ordered the croque madame, french toast, and the piece de la resistance... chicken and waffles! Can you believe Bouchon has a version of chicken and waffles? I blinked twice in disbelief looking at this menu item. 

Everything was not bad, and the service was impeccable. The runny egg on the croque madame was cooked to perfection, neither being too runny or too over cooked. The french toast came in a mini tower much to our surprise. We split it delightfully and the chicken and waffles, while not being fried chicken was roasted to a great savory moistness mixed with the sweet syrup and spongy waffle was a great

I found the menu to be a bit underwhelming. My friend and I ordered the polenta fries, warm Brie with poached pear, a french onion soup, and a veggie burger- all to share. The polenta fries were tasteless and not at all appetizing. The French onion soup was decent (not the best I've had but not the worst either), the veggie burger was just okay (also kind of bland), but the warm Brie with poached pear was phenomenal and the best part of our meal! 

If it wasn't for the warm Brie then I would say our meal would have been a total bust, but luckily the warm Brie dish redeemed our entire culinary experience at this place. The guy sitting next to me ordered the fish and chips and it looked good, but I would probably not be back.

1228,694,3.0,"It pains me to give this 'ok' rating for Sweets Raku when I was the one who told my boyfriend that I desperately wanted to come here. I learned of Sweets Raku through social media, their creative and different-looking desserts intrigued me. My boyfriend was also curious and wanted to go. So we watched videos on how certain ones were made and did research of what exactly we wanted. It was a point to come to Sweets Raku during our trip just so we could experience it.  

On our visit, they did not have ANY of the desserts we planned on ordering. The Ringo and Primavera was not on the menu. I was so disappointed. There wasn't even an 'edible' menu. I had no idea this was going to happen. As I'm writing this review, it looks like their website is updated and current right now....but it wasn't when I checked earlier this year. Maybe I just have bad luck coming at a time when Sweets Raku decided to change their menu.

We were told that a new dessert Ichigo was a replacement to Ringo, so that brought my hopes up a little and we ordered that. I didn't care for the other desserts, but we wanted to get one more so I just decided on the Angel Cream because the description sounded like a safe dessert with ingredients I would like. We also got some teas to help with digestion after eating the desserts.

ICHIGO - A white chocolate shell filled with strawberries, cake, and mousse. There's also an imitation strawberry that's made of a sugar shell filled with sorbet and more mousse. We enjoyed watching Chef Mio make it. She was so delicate with her hands and the end result looked perfect and too beautiful to eat. However, all this dessert tasted like was strawberries. I love strawberries, and so does my boyfriend but I guess we were expecting something different from this. The imitation strawberry on the side was fun to crack open and eat. I really liked the sorbet inside, that gave a tangy taste and it saved this dessert from having too much sweetness from the strawberries. 

ANGEL CREAM - A dome of fromage and pear cream with white chocolate wings and a 'candy' silver halo. This was really light and creamy which I liked. But it looked and tasted too simple. Nothing to be WOW'd about. Honestly, I wish I had gotten Mars or Mount Fuji instead for a better presentation.

So we paid $12 for each dessert. That's a lot to spend on something that just LOOKS GOOD. Seriously. The desserts are not worth anything else. Taste is mediocre and we were saying there are better looking AND tasting desserts at our bakeries back home where we live. Seems like Sweets Raku's had amazing desserts in the past, and that's how they garnered all these high Yelp reviews - but I feel like they are getting lazy and less creative. The desserts on the menu now are simple and not as complex as before. 

If you don't like eating much and just want to spend money on pretty presentation and visuals, come to Sweets Raku.",2017-02-27 08:24:56

586,173,5.0,"My husband and I used Bill Olmstead and his team for the purchase and sale of our first home with the recommendation from a friend. 

We were incredibly happy with our purchase. As first time homebuyers and moving from out of state we were literally and mentally in new territory. His team walked us through every step of the process and we were able to get something great for our growing family within our budget in such a competitive market.

What really stood out was how the sale of our home went. We had already made a few minor upgrades to the property, but when it came time to sell, Bill gave us a few pointers to polish up the place. Using all of his recommended vendors, we were able to accomplish this in a short time and for low cost. He appropriately read the market and priced our home reasonably, and we ended up selling our home within a few days and walked away with an extra $30,000 cash in our pockets.

Bill was very streamlined, communicative and thorough through the whole process. We would absolutely use his services again if we move back to Phoenix, and we recommend Bill Olmstead's team with the highest regard!",2016-04-11 17:24:06

1480,511,3.0,"People had been raving to me about Täkō and I have to say that I was rather disappointed when I finally made it there for dinner. It is quite a small restaurant and reservations for dinner go weeks in advance. You can eat at the bar without a reservation and it turns over relatively quickly, but you might be waiting for a bit. You can make a reservation on their website through Yelp SeatMe. I went with my boyfriend and we had to shout at each other and still couldn't really hear one another. It is incredibly loud in there. It is also so dark you can hardly see the menu or what you're eating. The decor is very confused, with some metal lockers, Christian paraphernalia, and black/red decor that might be found in a dungeon. It was rather dreadful of an atmosphere (the bar looks slightly better since it is a tiny bit better lit and you are sitting right next to anyone you go with, which should make hearing them a little easier). We started off with the house-made guacamole and were not at all impressed with it. I had the mushrooms tacos which were quite tasty, but not enough so to go there again. I had a pretty good mezcal-based drink. The prices were quite high for what we were getting.",2016-03-27 18:50:26

The ""made it yourself"" is fried calamari with jalapeños with tempura crumble and spicy mayo on top. I also got a mango mojito which was not bad.

307,537,3.0,"I got this hotel for a great deal on priceline (less than 115 per night)

This was my first trip to Vegas, so not really familiar with much of the hotels but I had several friends staying in other places. At first I thought maybe our room was smaller than some of the other hotels like Paris and the Monte Carlo, etc but after visiting our friends rooms I realized ours was the same size.

If you are picky about ""ritzy"" rooms, or looking to spend a lot of time in your hotel and want everything literally at your fingertips, this isn't the place to go. The casino and pool are small and there's nothing terribly ""Vegas"" about this hotel. No shops, only one restaurant, one bar... it's very small scale. 

For us, it was great. We just hung out at other hotels to get the kitschy Vegas experience but still had a comfortable nice room to come back to that was half the price of other hotels and within walking distance of lots of Vegas hotspots. I'd say if you are looking for an affordable nice room and willing to go out of your hotel to experience Vegas this is a great choice. 

The staff was very helpful, valet was quick, check-in was MUCH faster than it was for my other friends staying in other hotels, and because there's not 3000 rooms in this place its easy to get to your room without having to wait for an elevator or navigate a maze.",2008-08-18 21:37:58

Included in the price of the meal, they bring you carafes of red and/or white wine and you pour it yourself, and when you are out, they bring you more. Only in Vegas. Both the red and white were perfectly decent tasting house wines. THEN, this tiny, ancient man comes around to the tables playing an accordion. It's amazing.

356,662,5.0,"Rao's is Rao's is Rao's is Rao's. 

From the first time I stepped foot in Rao's in NYC and ate their meatballs I have been obsessed with the sauce, the simplicity and the history. 

The Las Vegas Rao's is not the same as walking into the Harlem Rao's in NYC and why would you want it to be! You can't recreate an original, but you can stir up a feeling, an energy and an atmosphere - this is what Las Vegas does. 

Everything is bigger in Vegas - including Rao's! Walking through Ceasar's Palace you can't miss Rao's. The iconic red corner restaurant greets you past the slot machines. While I did not make a reservation I would suggest you do so if you are trying to make a show or go during prime dinner/lunch service.

I chose to eat at the bar since I was solo. After taking my seat and ordering wine, I remembered the late Frankie Pellegrino telling me there was a recreation of the NYC Rao's in Vegas and asked the bartender which room it was - sure enough there it was! It is pretty spot on with the exception of the bar is missing and the regulars are still in NYC - look up the history of this restaurant you won't be disappointed. 

I returned to my seat at the bar placed my order and the servers started their cadence - wine came out, placemat, silverware, bread basket w/gourmet butters and my napkin - if you want full service come here!  Shortly after diving into the bread basket my ravioli followed from the kitchen. The portion was well worth the price and I was full all day! If I wasn't in the midst of conversation (and in a public place) I would have licked the bowl. 

The menu is pricey so keep this in mind, but it is delicious and will not disappoint. You are paying for an experience that many people will not ever have - while it is not as exclusive as NYC it is still an extension of Rao's, an extension of the family. Enjoy!",2018-01-10 02:34:04

We went through with the purchase with cash. They were suppose to email the receipt because they couldn't print anything being the system was down. Never got the receipt. Well major problem for me. Went to assemble the item purchased and I was wondering why the screw just kept falling out. Why cause the wood was already stripped and damaged. The lady in customer service said I could call the manufacturer have them send replacement piece. I was all why would I do that. I want to return this defective crap. I would be concerned that it just gonna be a problem going forward. I rather not. So here I'm going to return then they tell me I have to wait up to 2 weeks to get my payment back. That's just straight crap. Needless to say the entire experience is an inconvenience. I would never purchase from them again. For a person to pay with cash and you tell them you gotta wait up to 2 weeks to receive your payment back in check. How do I even know that I'll receive my payment back.

360,352,2.0,"The Good:
The casino is visually impressive, no doubt.  The circular layout reminds me of the Hard Rock in Las Vegas, only bigger.  Nice selection of good places to eat, as mentioned in Luckie's review.  Lot's of TV's, although the only channels being shown were ESPN (is there a reason they don't have the sports packages like a sports bar would have, such as NBA and NHL??).  There is a newer electronic roulette table that the old casino did not have, although it only seated 10 people or so.  We were there tonight (a Tuesday) and there were plenty of open slot and video poker machines to play at.  

The Bad:
We are low stakes players.  I enjoy $5 blackjack and the wife enjoys $5 three-card poker.  NO $5 minimum tables on a WEEK-night.  Everything $10 minimum.   The majority of tables were half full or empty.  I'm no math major, but it seems a full $5 table would bring in more rake than an empty $10 one.  We asked the dealer at the empty 3-card table about this and he flagged over the pit supervisor.  Both were friendly, but confessed they did not work at the old location and had no idea they had $5 minimum tables in the past.  The beers were $5 apiece at the bar.  

Summary:
The former Wild Horse Pass definitely catered to the working class, casual player.  The inexpensive, yet tasty, food grill that served a nice variety of foods has been replaced with the Boar Head Deli and Fatburger.  No more buffet.  Five dollar minimum tables gone.  This casino is definitely targeting the higher end, luxury players.  If you're looking to drop $5 a beer, a few hundred dollars at the tables and $100 on a steak dinner, this is your place.  As for us, we'll be driving the extra 20-minutes to Harrah's.",2009-11-04 04:02:06

We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.

My advice is to make a reservation, not because of a wait time, but because, its a great feeling to sit in the corner tables, and not in the middle, simply because its just more comfortable. They, of course, start bringing you the bread I mentioned in my last review. One nuance I noticed was the bread man was very serious about his table-setting, table-clearing and general discourse in the provision of services. He'd bring bread and have this focused look on his face. I'm always watching people working in restaurants to figure out what their work environment is like. He seemed tense and even perturbed when the main waiter brought us bread but didn't put it on the correct side of our place mats. He gave him a condescending glance after he cleared crumbs from the table with a little metal scooper object. Haha! Co-worker drama at a high end restaurant! But only because he wanted things to be perfect, and I respect the level of artistry put into anything in this life.
We had oysters and after I had a fish plate and she had something I can't remember. The surroundings, the service and beating the rush made this another unforgettable experience.

I will never come back.
Service was bad, food was bad (except the soup), atmosphere was nice although it opens into the slot machines at Luxor.

If you sit at the bar, there is a huge pillar with a flat screen, which is great for watching sports, but hides you away from the bartender if you sit to the righthand side.  
I had to get up and get his attention because he couldn't see me.
The girl that sat down next to me actually moved to one of the tables in the lounge because the service was so bad (she did get great service from the cocktail waitress though).

The Wild Mushroom soup was amazing, that is why the restaurant gets a star.  Have the soup, then go somewhere else for the main course.

The steak I ordered was tasteless, I had to order a side of bearnaise sauce to get it down and I love steak; I would eat steak everyday if I could, but not from here even if it was free (which it definately wasn't).  And the bearnaise was tasteless as well.  If I hadn't enjoyed the soup so much I would have thought something was wrong with my sense of taste.

The wine also tasted like it had been opened the day before or maybe even the day before that.  I'm not a wine snob, but it was like vinegar.  The bartender didn't even bother pouring a little for himself to see if it had gone bad.

I came out here a month ago and had dinner here with a friend and his cousins for dinner. It was a really small and quiet amount of people here on a Saturday night. I ordered the spaghetti and meatball dish which was a little bland. The italian bread was really good as the staff served us before our dinner was served. The restaurant is really small with a good outside view of Michaels and several other businesses outside the strip mall. Restaurants meets right by highway 60. Great place to come and dine or hang out with friends. Will be back again when i have the chance again.",2015-06-08 21:46:52

Spicy dumplings were so good and came with some rice noodles
Steamed dumplings are very good and so soupy. 
Snow pea sprouts are very good and good portion. 
Beef noodle soup was decent 4/5 star
Fried tofu was a surprise because it's not greasy and it's egg tofu! 
We ordered red bean pancake for dessert and it was 5 star!!

Food: The pork belly pastrami and chopped salad were the highlights of the evening as they were both delicious. We also ordered the buttermilk chicken, which was good but nothing special, and the scallops, which were extremely salty - on the border of being inedible.

I've had several dishes, all of which are excellent. In my opinion, this is also the best Thai in Pittsburgh.

Shrimp Pad Thai is fantastic. Good portion eat in or take-out, with tons of big, juicy shrimp. The Cottage Wings are quite honestly the best wings I've had in Pittsburgh. I could probably eat 20+ of these things at a time. Everything I've eaten has been perfect.

The staff is also very welcoming. The taller lady (I think she may be the owner or manager) always greets us with a friendly smile, kind words, and excellent service. She seems to really be doing what she loves (and she's doing a great job). We have never waited for a table here, even with the place being as tiny as it is.

My girlfriend and I live close enough to walk to this place, and we do so on a fairly regular basis. It's our go-to if we want to stay local.

The only (small) complaints are as follows: They serve soda in cans, but this is sort of the modus operandi for a lot of Thai restaurants, so I can't really come down too hard on them for this one. The other issue is how close the seating can be, but this sort of thing comes with the territory in the city.",2017-01-02 05:29:08

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

Two stars or even one if not for the Bloody Mary meal or Jack Daniels chocolate cake.",2016-05-07 01:58:41
1085,202,1.0,"Not a bad massage, but if you're looking for relaxation, do not even waste your time.  

I've had three massages here over the last six years.  The first was an introductory rate, and was just average, but I was feeling somewhat relaxed when it was over.  Then the receptionist started in on all the membership options and how, if I didn't join and commit to having the $49 deducted from my credit card (which I didn't possess at the time) each month, it would cost me an insane amount for any future massages.

The second time was more than a year later, and I'd forgotten I'd been there previously.  They had my name and address in their computer, so they said I had to join if I wanted the $49 rate.  When I said I couldn't join at that time, they said it'd be $90.  I said forget it, and they said they'd still have to charge me for the session.  Once again I said forget it and was about to leave when a supervisor said I could have the $49 rate one more time without joining.  My 60-minute massage lasted 48 minutes and was below average.

Finally, three years later a friend gave me a gift card for a free massage.  The manager was downright nasty and said, for the entire waiting room to hear as though she wanted to embarrass me, that if the whole $90 wasn't paid on the card that I couldn't get the massage nor my friend's money back.  Turned out it she did pay the $90, so I got my 43-minute massage with no apology or explanation, and I walked out totally frustrated.

I've resolved never again to give them a cent of my money, and if the chain were smart they'd fire that horrible shrew of a manger.  But since the chain has made it clear they are far more interested in signing people up for long-term commitments than they are providing what they offer (a relaxing, 60-minute massage), it seems pretty obvious they are not smart and care not a bit about customer satisfaction.",2014-06-11 19:14:27

601,333,4.0,"Watching a Thunder from Down Under show for the first time feels like an initiation.  Like discovering a secret place where it's socially acceptable for everyday women to completely lose their minds.

I was planning on staying coherent enough to write an anthropological study on this phenomenon, but it was too powerful even for me.  Before I knew it, I, too, was screaming giddily and spilling my vodka cranberry on the poor lady next to me.

In my addled state of mind, I couldn't tell you too many details about the show itself.  It's basically a mix of acts.  Group dances, one-person dances, bits where the host calls people on stage.  The dances usually end with a random audience member chosen and brought up on stage for some very classy second-base fondling.  The music and costumes are gloriously cheesy (""Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy,"" natch).  The performers don't stick to the stage, so don't be surprised if a sweaty buff man in kneepads jumps up onto your table and gyrates his speedo in your face.  I mean, maybe that doesn't surprise you anyway, but just a heads-up.

Though I didn't find the show particularly titillating, the big emotional impact came from being surrounded by a vortex of screaming women and from being in close proximity to really hot, shirtless guys.  There was also the mixture of abject horror and fascination that came with watching a grandmother who looked like Mrs. Doubtfire eagerly reaching into a guy's leather pants and stroking him.  I don't know about you, but that's not something I get to see every day.  

If you go with a group of your spunkiest friends, the fun increases exponentially.  I recommend that you get liquored up beforehand, as the drinks in the theater are overpriced and a bit slow in coming (like your mum).     

There's no stuffing of cash into G-strings, but the performers take photos after the show for $20 (cash).  You should do this, because you are creepy like me. 

The shirtless guy taking my money: What's your name?  
Me: Rebecca.
Shirtless guy: Oh.  That's Bicky.  We'd call you Bicky in Australia.
Me: Yes.  Yes, sir.
Shirtless guy: (leading me to the sofa) Everyone, this is Bicky.

Then followed an odd moment when I realized just how incredibly sweaty these men get.  They pulled me down on their laps (I swear) and they were soaked.  I almost slid off.  There were towels piled under the sofa.  Luckily I know the butterfly stroke and was able to get out of there.  

P.S.  The current performers are a lot better-looking than the ones on the posters and promotional materials, some of which look to be from 1998.  Don't worry, ladies.  The new ones look nothing like the curly-haired guy from Color Me Badd.",2013-08-07 17:03:39

848,38,4.0,"I like enchiladas.  So, naturally, I have been frequenting Gadzooks for a little over a month now and am more than happy to submit an almost perfect review of their establishment.
Pros:
Food is amazing.  With a very from scratch taste and feel I appreciate, along with new items that hit the chalk board and run the risk of availability, it's hard to go in and get the same old same old every time.  This is the one thing places like Chipotle can't exactly replicate and I admire; new flavors and dishes are what make this stand apart.
Enchiladas are made to order with enough customization choices to keep you going back.   Pulled Buffalo enchiladas? I managed the last one and considered putting it up on EBAY.  The enchilada oven.  There is something special about watching your dish enter the oven and the cheese bubbles with happiness.  
Cons:  
Get there early.  Parking is at a premium though not as bad as most places on 7th st.  Here is my issue; the line.  The whole process operates like subway, chipotle, etc which isn't too bad but for the fact that your dish can come out of the oven and sit for minutes until you are able to pay, fight the single drink dispenser, and get seated.  I have on more than one occasion diverted to another restaurant if I spot a line out the door.  
True, good things come to those who wait but I dislike lines for food so that is my only hangup with Gadzooks, who otherwise has some of the tastiest enchiladas made to order I have had the pleasure of sampling for some time.",2015-01-05 20:10:32

And I can't say that lightly as we love brunch and have been to some of the top places in the top cities for brunch.

Basically the deal here is you play a flat amount (like $40) and they serve unlimited small plates. Options range from Benedicts to Chilaquiles to Chicken and Waffles to Shrimp and Grits. I will be real in that I tried almost everything and loved everything I tried! 

The big standouts were the Chicken and Waffles, Steak and Eggs, and Chilaquiles. They also gave us a guava empanada which was not on the menu but was awesome! 

My pro tip: when ordering don't have everyone get the same thing. Mix and match and share! Otherwise you will fill up fast! 

Other pro tip: make a reservation. We got there at 11am which was a tad early for brunch there but by 1pm it was packed in there!",2018-01-21 17:52:25

The portions were huge, the flavors were good, the bloody mary from the front desk was very helpful (although getting one took so long. The guy had to go in the back and 25 minutes came back with ours. He could have sold 5 times more if he could just take orders and have the bar deliver the drinks quickly.

Being a student I frequent coffee shops to not only indulge in my coffee obsession but to be able to peruse the World Wide Web so I may conduct research while I study, and after I placed my order and took my seat to get down to business, much to my dismay, the wifi was not connecting, so I asked the barista who then told me sorry but the wifi was out of service and didn't know when it would be up and running again. BAD customer service! I get you still want to make money and conduct your business, but you should be honest and give people the choice if they want to patronize you if you do not have certain in demand services available. The coffee was good and bran muffin was very tasty, and I love the 50 cent refill option, but I'm deducting starts for the lack of communication about the Internet.",2013-01-27 20:29:38

1021,207,5.0,"Jade Palace Pinnacle Peak is a Masterpiece!

This is the finest Chinese restaurant in all of Arizona and one of the best spots in all of North Scottsdale.

The new location is gorgeous, stylish, elegant, and just plain wonderful.  Jade Palace has been around in the Valley for many years and it continues to improve in every possible way. I have experienced fantastic service and really enjoy so many of the friendly and engaging members of the wait staff.  Whenever possible ask for Karen shes awesome.

I began eating at Jade about 6 years ago and used to frequent the Shea location, until I discovered Devlan, Hugh, and their exceptional staff.  The Mei family is kind, friendly, and all about providing an enjoyable and fun dining experience. This kind of family run, high-end restaurant is seldom seen anymore, especially in Scottsdale.

The 5-Star experience can easily be shared by all with few simple tips...

-Make a reservation.

-Ask for Hugh Mei, he is the general manager and truly the best possible guide for a delish and lovely experience. Hugh will help insure that your service is excellent.

-Try new dishes and be open to suggestions, especially with the wonderful seafood specialties. Jade has some really incredible dishes!

And the best possible suggestion to understand the culture of Jade Palace is to prepare yourself and your party for a true dining experience of 1.5+ hours. They also have a wonderful bar culture of regular patrons who dine at the bar, share stories, and relax over great cocktails/wine, and custom made dishes never found on any menu.

The Mei family loves to eat, drink, and share family time.  This is exactly how they run Jade Palace, as an extension of their friends/family.  The true Chinese experience is had family style, sharing many dishes, pouring wine, enjoying laughter, and savoring each amazing bite and taste.  

Jade often gets very busy, especially on the weekends and holidays. So plan accordingly and allow for extra time to sit, enjoy, relax, and have a wonderful experience.

There are so many must, do not miss dishes on the menu so I will share a couple of my faves and then you can explore on your own.  The NY style Egg Rolls are delish, and the BBQ Spare Ribs are Amazeballs!! The Sizzling Rice soup is bomb.com... I am a huge fan of the House Chow Fun. The Seabass is out of this world, and they cook the Filet Mignon to perfection, all of the chicken dishes come out tender and delish. One of my most favorite dishes is the Imperial Duck!!!! It is unreal good, dripping with flavor, crispy on the edges, lean, and yummm-yummm good! My last tip on found is the Green Bean side dish-- just ask for it Hugh style and be prepared to slurp up every single bean on your plate.

Jade's menu always includes seasonal specialties such as Lobster, uniquely prepared vegetables, and often some unreal Roasted Chicken dishes!

Be prepared to spend a few dollars, share lots of great food, and sip on some really great wine.  Oh and the Dirty Blue-Cheese Olive Martini is the best in all of Scottsdale...

In case you can't make it this far North, try the Jade Shea location just off the 101 and Shea.  Truthfully the food may be slightly better by way of the longer seasoned cookware, but by no way much different. The wine won't be nearly as exceptional, but you will enjoy Shea Jade and it's a great place to order Take-Out.

I am a big fan of Jade Palace and you will be as well.  For a quick and delish option-- order Take-Out and pick up your food.  Their take out is awesome and you will have a great time eating their tasty dishes at your own comfy place.

Hopefully I will see you at their bar soon!",2015-02-13 00:34:44
177,204,5.0,"Like the 5 star rating says...Woohoo!  As good as it gets!  I would challenge those reading to find a better setting...inside or out on the patio for a great night out in Chandler.  

We attended to celebrate my wife's birthday, as well as 4 others that attended Vintage 95 last night.  We had a party of 16 and the service was great.  The server was sharp, quick to meet our needs, and a pleasure to talk with.  Many in our party had never visited and they all loved the atmosphere...and the company of course!

One of the great things about Vintage 95 are the cheese plates, served on butcher block, with your personalized choices of cheese, (you can personalize your meat choices to if you wish) they have nuts, olives, dried fruit...all which pair great with your favorite wine.  

We love wine and if you love wine or are interested in tasting wine, Gavin, the owner, has created a remarkable wine list  and is very acommodating to all of his customers...Just ask for him or his manager and they will help with wine selections and then sit back and enjoy the live music, and the fire place.  AND ALL of this is in downtown CHANDLER!

Gavin and his partners have done a great thing the the city in the first 3 months of his business...and he reported it is even going to get better with dinner service soon...we can't wait.

580,35,4.0,"Does another Memorial Day have to be another drive to the coast or the mountains? Do we really have to, yet again, find an ocean side city or a bay to to enjoy an urban weekend? I struggled for weeks because I just couldn't deal with driving 10 miles an hour in a 45 or 55 MPH zone behind cyclists riding three across on a state highway. I couldn't imagine trying to enjoy a walk while bicycles fly by me at 20 MPH. What to do? I've always been contemptuous of Las Vegas, But I'm also sick of coming home after a weekend away more stressed than when I left because of speeding up and slowing down for bicycles, rounding a curve and slamming on my brakes for cyclists riding two or three across,  and getting flipped off half the time. 

I opened my mind and accepted the Venetian as an alternative. After several visits for conferences or meetings, I knew that the canal was a pleasant place to enjoy a walk and stop for dinner, so I took the plunge and did something different. It was the best move I've ever made. After just an evening I realized just how much having to dealing with bicycles everywhere else degrades the experience and the general quality of life. Yes, Las Vegas is a manufactured environment, but it's a GOOD manufactured environment. For the first time in a long time I feel completely relaxed after a weekend away.",2013-05-28 22:37:52

However, the food courses blew us ALL away. We started off with a small plate of ceviche tacos that were the BEST I have ever had. Among other favorites: sea bass skewers, beef with truffles and some sort of dumpling plate. 

Can't wait to go back! Next time, we'll just tell them to shut up and take our money. The flight course is quoted at 40-50 per person.

1016,624,3.0,"I've been to Boiling crab on Friday and was told Hot n Juicy was better.  So here's my review.

Food: Boiling crab's sauce to me seems to have more flavor.  The shrimp here didn't taste as fresh.  Maybe I came on a bad night?  The fried catfish was a disappointment as well.

Price:  Boiling Crab is a tad less expensive.  Not too much to make or break the deal.

Service:  Boiling Crab.  Our server was really friendly and attentive and funny.  Did I mention he was cute.  I may just come back for him. ;)  Hot n Juicy was friendly but our waitress seemed to be in a rush.  This was a Monday night. 

Atmosphere:  Boiling crab was a lot bigger so I felt less Claustrophobic.  

Alcohol:  This one goes to Hot n juicy.  They have a bigger selection on drinks.  

Boiling Crab 4 - Hot N Juicy  1

624,396,3.0,"We came here one night after dinner for the sole reason of getting more buzzed/drunk. It was a pretty chill atmosphere: dark, with music, and some space for dancing.

They have a huge variety of drinks (with a full bar), mostly centered around margaritas; it is, afterall, in their name. If you want their strongest drink, get the Perfect Margarita (gold tequila, silver tequila, triple sec, orange curacao and lime juice on the rocks. I can't say it tasted very good because, well, it didn't; but it did its job.

I may have been drunk after an additional shot of grey goose, but I'm calling BS on this extra tax they charged us. The sales tax in Vegas is 8.1%, but they charged us 18.1%. I knew something wasn't right when the tax they charged was higher than the amount listed next to the suggested 15% tip amount. When I asked our server about it, he said all places in Vegas charge an extra 10% tax at places where they have entertainment. That's the first time I've ever heard about something like that. What BS! I won't be coming back.",2010-11-22 23:01:07

Everyone I knew absolutely RAVED about this place, so one evening, my family and I went. The service was awful, the food was cold, and they brought me out food with an allergen on it (which I SPECIFICIALLY told the server about). We chalked it up to the thought that this place is known for breakfast, and we were there in the evening. Our fault; let's try again in the morning sometime.

So we did. Again... epic failure. The service was terrible, the food was mediocre, and we had to ask repeatedly for someone to even bring our drinks  (yes, that's part of service, but deserves its own mention). It's been a few months now, but I just can't see going back.

Why do people like this place? I'm so confused when I see lines out the door. Was it just that we had 2 bad experiences that were flukes?  I can't see that.",2016-02-26 15:03:11

1135,303,4.0,"My first trip the Caledonian was a bit of a mixed bag, and if Yelp had a 3.5 star rating, I'd be inclined to lean towards it.  However, I'm going to have to settle on a 3 star. 

Ok on to the details.....

Our group showed up at the Caledonian later in the evening for a night-cap and was told that on Thursday's the bar has last call at 1am. With a statutory holiday looming on the next day, a few fellow Yelpers piped up to say, ""Even on Holy Thursday!?' 

Yes...apparently even on Holy Thursday. 

Considering the bar was fairly full with patrons looking to unwind (get drunk) without the worry of an early morning the next day it certainly came as a bit of a surprise, and I'm sure the Caledonian missed out on a boatload of extra revenue. On the bright side, the waitress was more then understanding and let us nurse our beers until 2 am. (Disclaimer: After writing that last sentence, I adjusted the Yelp rating to a 4. Must give credit, where credit is due.)

The atmosphere and feel of the Caledonian is great and while I can't speak for the food they offer, they've got a great patio out back that smells like rich, new MDF board (Disclaimer 2: I once worked at a woodworking factory. When you head out back, look up under the awning. That my friend is MDF board...and yes it was brand spanking new on my visit). 

If the weather had of been a few degrees warmer I'm sure our group would have enjoyed our beers a little more. I can easily see this patio being a big hit come summer time and hopefully the scent of new MDF has subsided.

I'm looking forward to my next trek to the Caledonian this summer to enjoy a nice cold beer on the patio......I just hope that last call on the weekends is 2am!",2011-04-23 03:21:24

The rooms are GORGEOUS. I recently had the opportunity to stay in the Corner Suite, and it exceeded my expectations. The room featured an unparalleled strip view of the Bellagio fountains, a full kitchen with dining table/stove/dishwasher, a washer/dryer, a huge living room, an incredibly comfortable bed, a large soaking tub, and a really nice vanity area.
I will say that if you are here for pleasure, navigating around the strip can be a little tricky due to an odd location and unmarked pedestrian entrances. And reception at the front desk is hit or miss. My last check-in agent was pretty rude when I asked for a late check-out, and essentially told me that nobody at the hotel could help me.

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

- depending on the menu item/meat choice you're going for, you have to go into separate lines accordingly; if you're in a group and you're smart about it just have different people in your group go into the different lines and then Venmo amount owed to one another
- after ordering your food, your food is given to you on the spot, and then you go to ANOTHER line in the far right corner in between the indoor seating and the outdoor seating to the cash register to pay for your food
NOTE: yes of course the workers here speak English, but I personally feel if you're with a Spanish speaker, AND you're nice, then the workers will try their best to help you get the other meat choices you're trying to order without having to go in the separate lines

THE TASTE:
- LENGUA IS MY LIFE! especially when it's made WELL; when we go here we usually will get lengua fries (because carne asada fries are basic) and lengua tacos
- I'm a BIG fan of their tacos here, but I will have to say that generally speaking I'm just not a fan of cabeza or buche, but hey, at least I can say I've tried it

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- the servers have always been pretty efficient and super nice
- security guard(s) onsite are nice too, unlike bouncers at clubs sometimes
- the cashiers can be pretty curt, but that's OK",2017-10-02 21:40:03

1895,678,1.0,"If I could post zero stars, that's what I would do.  Let me preface this with the fact that we got here at 7pm on a Saturday...busy time for sure, but a restaurant should be able to forecast for that. After placing our orders, our waiter let's me know that I got the last order of brisket available (again, it's only 7pm on a saturday). Next, our food comes and here's where the real fun starts. My Mom's pulled pork looks chopped (as opposed to actually pulled) and it's DRY AS A BONE. I live in Chicago and maybe I'm a bit of a BBQ snob, but meats should be able to stand on their own...they shouldn't  require sauce to make it moist or give it taste. Best part? They didn't have enough containers for sauce to go around so we had to wait like 5 minutes before they even brought us any! Now, on to my entree.  I ordered 8oz of brisket. Sadly, ~3oz of it is fat and gristle. For $19, I think I deserve a full 8oz of edible meat. My wife's ribs were OK, but definitely not great. Our sides were pretty ""meh"" all around. All of the most new at our table were fairly tasteless (Mac & cheese, candied yams, corn succatash, cornbread)...definitely nothing great. Oh, and they kept forgetting stuff. My cornbread came out without any butter, and my mom's Mac n cheese came out like 5-7 minutes after the rest of our food. All in all, for what they are charging, I'd be expecting a WHOLE lot more.",2014-12-14 04:09:19
216,102,5.0,"I saw their menu online and when I saw the Korean food ingredients, I knew that I had to check this place out because I'm part Korean.

I ordered the angry hot dog because I like spicy foods and when I took a big...I was hit with so much good flavors. It was so good.

My brother ordered the bulgoigi dog and it looked good too. My brother scarfed it down and he is a picky eater and doesn't like hot dogs that much so I'm glad he liked it.  

There is more menu items than what it displayed in on the website. There is so many things I want to try there so I am definitely coming back here.",2015-02-02 09:49:16
853,592,3.0,"We came here with an online deal for a pre fixed menu. It had multiple courses including sushi and steak. It seemed mediocre and I was not impressed by the quality of the fish and overall dishes. The steak that came out in the end was too salty and had too much teriyaki sauce. But I guess, Nobu seems to be a fusion restaurant. 

Other than food, the service was excellent and attentive.",2017-12-31 19:22:39
832,77,2.0,Unfortunately the  beef swarma was extremely tough and service disappointing. Staff is very young and unattentive and needs training in guest service. I did not see owner and that could be problem too. They could learn from Great Greek. :(,2016-07-31 02:13:17

The shrimp san remo was delicious as we're the lobster, king crab, and amaretto cheesecake! The whole experience was just great.

584,351,5.0,Amazing. Best oil change experience I've ever had. They make it clear on what you need and what you can afford to wait a bit on. Multiple oil options based on your usage. You don't leave feeling like they were trying to upsell you. They offer what they can do and why it would be necessary and you make your own decisions. Great crew. Def will be back for my top off and next oil change.,2017-02-07 18:42:51
1242,88,4.0,"Came here to see Above & Beyond, and had an awesome time! I really liked how open and airy the outdoor area is. I should've stayed out there so I could've had room to dance, but it was still really fun. The not so big dance floor got packed fast and closed pretty early on in the night. Fearing I wouldn't be able to return back to the main room, I ended up just staying inside. Despite the packed crowd, everyone was friendly and gave it a fun atmosphere. A&B's set was also really enjoyable and kept the energy up. At one point, they directed a snide remark towards will.i.am for his rip off of Rebound which left the crowd cheering. With its beautiful setup, Surrender is definitely one of my favorite venues in Vegas. Untz Untz Untz

Tip: If you need to get a cab after the night is done at XS or Surrender, walk over to the Palazzo and grab a cab without the absurd lines.",2013-05-30 03:38:47

686,26,3.0,"Tasty, but a pricey breakfast.

Came at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon and although there was no line to place an order, there was a 25 minute wait for the food.... I noticed that some people got their orders as soon as they showed up so I highly recommend ordering ahead by phone if thats possible.

The Gaucho Sandwich $15 was amazzzing with its wagyu tri tip steak and chimichuri sauce.  I would definitely order this again even though it's crazy expensive for just a sandwich.  

The Slut $10.50 on the other hand tasted like mash potatoes .  I did not care for this at all. 

For 2 sandwiches and a slut, I paid $37.  Pretty expensive but worth trying if you have not had it before AND if there is no wait.  Otherwise save the experience for another day.",2018-09-03 03:57:48
1405,766,4.0,"I enjoyed this hotel. The location is great, and it's a short walk to get to everything on the strip. They do have several restaurants but unfortunately I didn't try any since I wanted to try random places in town. 

The rooms are fairly small, but they are decorated with a simple, modern style that I really liked. It is crowded all the time and there is a constant flow of people in the lobby, but it's Vegas so that seems normal. Would definitely stay here again.",2017-10-29 16:29:51
815,195,5.0,"After reading the countless reviews on this company, I called to schedule an appointment for my home. I am glad that I made this choice. Noble Carpet Cleaners is a reputable company with excellent customer service skills. Within a day, the owner Jacob, arrived on time and completed high quality work in an efficient manner. The employees at this organization demonstrate high levels of interpersonal skills and are genuinely concerned with meeting your carpet cleaning needs without imposing any upgrades during their interaction.

I have a new puppy who had left carpet stains throughout my dining room. Although a small portion of the stains I know will be permanent, Jacob did an excellent job of minimizing their appearance and removed most of the stains. Noble prices are fairly reasonable. There are many companies that charge less, but as I have experienced in the past, you get what you pay for.",2015-10-10 19:51:17
375,594,5.0,This place is the place to go to in uptown if you're looking to get really great food at a very reasonable price. They make their pasta in house and it is delicious. We always get a pizza and pasta to split and have came here 20+ times. Yes sometimes it can be busy but that just means it's good!,2018-08-29 21:40:38
936,117,5.0,"Best brunch ever? Best Brunch ever! 

And I can't say that lightly as we love brunch and have been to some of the top places in the top cities for brunch.

Basically the deal here is you play a flat amount (like $40) and they serve unlimited small plates. Options range from Benedicts to Chilaquiles to Chicken and Waffles to Shrimp and Grits. I will be real in that I tried almost everything and loved everything I tried! 

The big standouts were the Chicken and Waffles, Steak and Eggs, and Chilaquiles. They also gave us a guava empanada which was not on the menu but was awesome! 

My pro tip: when ordering don't have everyone get the same thing. Mix and match and share! Otherwise you will fill up fast! 

Other pro tip: make a reservation. We got there at 11am which was a tad early for brunch there but by 1pm it was packed in there!",2018-01-21 17:52:25
856,663,3.0,"I'd give it the exact 3.5 stars it has currently for almost no good reason: the waiter service is attentive and satisfactory---the food portions are gargantuan and generous---the interior is comfortable enough and has fun decoration.
The only issue is that picking a restaurant in Vegas gets you stuck in a vicinity for a long time unless you cab it. At Hash House, you're stuck at the Imperial Palace.
Food was good but not memorable.",2012-10-29 18:50:35
642,740,3.0,A great variety to pick from. Was disappointed in the server who helped us. She never came to greet us.

I love the food, truly do, but the service at this location is most certainly 5 points under where it should be. We were taking our friends to dinner to share with them some very important news on a Saturday. We arrived at 6:30 and checked in for a party of 6, was told it'd be a 25 minute wait. At 7:00 I decided to check and see how much longer and was told that my party was already seated. I informed the little hostess that we were not, we were all outside, and she blankly stared at me in disbelief. I asked how much longer and she said probably another 25 minutes. They had my name written down along with what shirt I was wearing and I at no point saw another women with a blue striped tank top arrive with a party of 6 so I demanded to see the manager. Instead of getting the manager she went and got the bartender, who was by no means apologetic for their obvious mistake. Nothing was done or suggested to try and make up for their error and we were left going across the street to Chipotle. I will NEVER be returning to the Gilbert Nando's again.",2015-04-17 22:45:29

Good portions and we were served quickly even though the place was packed.  The staff are all very friendly.  They take the Entertainment card every visit.  Always order takeout from here as well.  No matter how large the order they always have it ready by the time I get there within 20 minutes.  Love this place.",2016-01-04 04:57:07
1517,553,2.0,"My boyfriend and I found ourselves at this restaurant by chance. The atmosphere was lively and a very good guitarist played among the tables. The building is older, but interesting. I liked the layout, with the pond in middle and kids feeding the ducks. Service was friendly and average.

Based on recommendations found here, I ordered the pollo fundido and was not disappointed. It was very good.

After all of this, are you wondering why the two-star review? It comes down to one thing. SALSA. It's not hard to make a simple, pleasant salsa. One can be a self-declared talent-less cook and still manage to produce a palatable salsa. With my salsa-addicted boyfriend and our history of always polishing off the salsa and chips provided with the meal, we left our table with three salsas remaining.

One was a tomatillo salsa.  It was probably the best of the three,...after adding a substantial amount of salt to it. (We were told the secret ingredient of this was iceberg lettuce.)

The second salsa had a weird underlying flavor to it, almost like paprika. It was just funky. (The secret ingredient of this concoction was dried pepper, which probably explains the smokey flavor it had.)

The third salsa was more like a mushy tomato sauce. It would be best paired with mozzarella sticks.  (This salsa, the house salsa, was made with canned tomatoes and garlic. That's it. Seriously?) 

For a Mexican restaurant that puts out good food, salsa of this poor quality is inexcusable and a little shocking.",2014-07-27 21:46:33

391,35,1.0,"For starters, the shuttle service took over an hour to come pick us up from the airport. It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The ""resort fee"" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we'll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM.",2011-08-25 04:32:15
