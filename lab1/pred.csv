1214,31,,"Probably the WORST buffet in Las Vegas. This place makes the already not-so-great, Vegas buffet in Glendale, CA. look good.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafood-buffet-glendale#hrid:JnIwxV7PDcIRU7PhAETMrA) 

I bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is. 

The line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.

When you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees? 

I barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies. 

I will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again.",2012-06-26 19:10:08
272,377,,We brought an iPad mini to be fixed. They are fairly priced and very knowledgeable.  They fixed it in 1 day. We definitely will use them again.,2016-10-15 02:38:08
921,8,,"WHY WE WENT HERE:
- we dedicated the ""only meal of the day"" for a buffet lunch
- the first buffet we went to (which was located in another hotel, I forget which and its name) turned us down because we had several guys in our group who didn't have sleeved shirts on upon entrance

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE/INSIDE):
- hard to miss an open space that has nothing but food
- looks somewhat like a food court

THE WAY IT WORKS:
- go in from the entrance, where the cash registers are
- pay for your meal and indicate how many are in your party
- you are then assigned seating according to how big your party is
- unlimited beer and wine go along with your buffet meal

WHAT THEY HAVE:
- desserts
- cold items (i.e. meats and cheeses like when you drink wine; salad area)
- Asian
- Latino
- American
- Carving
- Italian
- bar
- Seafood

WHAT WE HAD:
- a little bit of everything
- the Latino portion was just sad and not authentic at all
- the Asian portion was fairly decent
- the cold items portion was only good from the meats and cheeses; the salads didn't look fresh
- the desserts were just ok
- the carving and seafood stations were on point! (I wouldn't know about the seafood personally, but a lot of the people in my group kept going back to that station)
- some of the things in the Italian section were selectively better than others (i.e. pasta)

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- the register people aren't pleasant
- the seating attendants are VERY welcoming
- the bartender worked fairly slow and had a hard time remembering our 2 drinks we ordered",2015-07-15 20:25:10

The portions of meat and cheese are very generous. I have never had any problems with the food or employees here. I love that I can call in my order and walk right up to the register, pay and leave in no time. Try the barbacoa!!!",2016-03-13 02:09:01

The food was brought to us within ten minutes of ordering (successfully taming the hangry beast that was brewing) and any modification to our order was done correctly! The food itself was pretty good. 
-- I highly recommend the banana nutella crepes. 

Overall I was very impressed with this recent visit. Keep up the good work!",2016-11-21 20:14:25

49,24,,"Having dined at many other Vegas buffets (the Wynn, the Paris, the Mirage, etc.) I found myself very underwhelmed. Everyone raves about the Bellagio buffet but I just kept wishing I had gone to the Wynn.
The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.
I will say that the fruit was fresh and yummy (melon, berries, etc.) and the desserts were good, but it wasn't enough to make me want to come back here ever again.",2010-07-07 16:03:41
76,972,,"Smaller efficient hub, especially relative to other major hub behemoths like DFW, ORD, JFK.

Though the walkways between terminals can be long if the people movers are down. ..

Golden Nugget, Las Vegas, the Grotto, the best. 
Also, Monique was a great server. Very attentive, and funny and informative about what was going on in Vegas for the weekend.
We will always be back.... At least 3 times while we are in town:)))))",2013-10-24 16:25:54
1896,675,,"This is a place that we have enjoyed for years, but, as of recently, we have had some bad experiences there.
I don't know if this is new or old, rules, rules, rules!!
When ordering the Chicken parmesan, I asked for angelhair pasta instead of the penne that it comes with. You would think, simple, but nooooo, there is no changing the pasta on ANY item. come on, how silly is that. How much effort is it to make a customer happy.
Ok , then, one day I ordered a sandwich to go, phoned it in. Upon arriving to pick it up, I saw my kids there having lunch, so I thought I'd join them. I informed the waitress that I have a sandwich that I ordered, and wanted that. I was told if I have a to go order, I cannot sit down and enjoy it.\
Seriously!!!
With so many restaurant choices in the valley, you would think that this restaurant would do whatever it takes to make the customer happy.
So, Time square might be busy and doing well now, but, one day they might not be with such harsh rules in place",2015-03-18 16:27:33
785,516,,Always s good experience here you get bang for your buck. I mean one salad could feed 2 ppl. This visit I had the chili lime chicken salad and it was great !!! Full of flavor and texture and a healthy portion !!! I also ordered the fresh baked cookies they are so moist DVD chewy they are just is a yummy treat !!! And they are made fresh to your order so if you want them right after your food the order them when you place your food order. !!!,2017-06-15 08:04:14
669,684,,"Honestly one of the best experience I had in awhile. The ambience was great, the service was adequate, and the food was superb. 

At first you're kind of confused as to how to enter but as soon as you press the door bell you are greeted by someone through a secret window and enter through a secret door. Already started off with a bang! Our server was Brandon. Highly suggest asking for him, he was super funny and very attentive. The food came out within perfect times. Didn't feel overwhelmed whatsoever. 

Highly suggest trying their calamari, it melts in your mouth and the sauce isn't overwhelming. I ordered there spaghetti and meatballs, which is what their known for. Their tomato sauce is truly one of a kind. Though I wasn't fond of the meatball because of the rosemary, everyone else at my table thought it was fantastic. 

We came for my step dad's birthday. I told the host earlier in the evening we have a celebrant. At the end we ordered the dessert and the live singer sung happy birthday which really topped it off. The homemade cannoli's are to die for!!!!! As soon as I finished I wanted more. Overall the experience was great and everyone there is so welcoming. For sure coming back!",2017-02-10 04:42:40

65,72,,"In town for a convention and needed a non sports book place to watch a hockey game. Web and Yelp mentioned they had a comfortable bar so I decided to check it out.

My bartenders Denise and Ruth were wonderful. The place was very busy but my drink was always full, they delivered my snacks, and were even able to help me charge my phone!!

Since I was watching the game I stayed at the bar, but the lounge looks great and I will check it out next time I'm in town. There are comfortable booths and a great circular fire pit. The waitresses were also very friendly. 

The margaritas were good. Can't speak to the food because I only had chips and salsa, but the restaurant and waiting area were packed when I was leaving. Might not have the big chef name or be associated with a casino but it suited my needs perfectly.",2014-01-18 08:08:56

Last time about 3 months ago the service was horrible and the food was mediocre at best. Today I ordered the couscous protein bowl. I'm allergic to onions and the description did not state that onions were included in the dish. Aside from peanuts - onions is one of the most allergic food types in the American diet. You would think that the menu would mention it ? The bowl had 5 little strips of chicken. Two of them were 90 percent fat. Just another poor experience at place that I will no longer visit, even with all the free food coupons they give away this place is just no good. Period",2018-01-25 21:24:45

1386,291,,"Early December, 2017, a software update showed in my phone settings under General, software update. On 12-21-17 I went into the settings to process the update. It had a bug in it. It wouldn't take my numeric passcode I use daily on the home screen. Same day approx lunch time, I called Verizon who took my monthly payment over the phone then had me reset the passcode in settings to the same passcode. It did not work and I was now locked out of my phone. I could not dial out - only emergencies.  I couldn't call Verizon or anyone. I used my iPad and went online to Verizon and got Zack on chat. I told him I just got off the phone with Verizon who locked my phone and how could Verizon fix it. He asked me where I changed my passcode. I said the settings screen. He said he could not help me and sent me a link for passcodes to work.  
The link says to go to itunes, plug your phone in and click 'recover.'  I plugged it it into my laptop. A message came up on my laptop asking to allow to connect to my iPhone. I clicked yes or allow. It clocked then came up with an error message that it could not connect to the phone. The phone never showed a message on the locked screen to connect to the laptop. I turned the phone off and on. Nothing happened. It still would not take my passcode. 
I immediately left for the nearest verizon store on 7th Street and Bell Road. 
I told a guy there was a software update that would not take my passcode on that screen. I told him I called verizon about an hour ago who had me reset my passcode to the same one and now I'm locked out of my phone. He blamed Apple and said Verizon is not responsible for Apple. He said you need to call Apple or go to an Apple store. I said I need to cancel my account then. He said I couldn't cancel my phone in the store. Your going to have to call verizon. I said with a phone that doesn't work?  He said you can use a phone here. I called verizon and told them the same issue. They blamed Apple. I said if Apple can't fix this, I'm going to cancel my account. She put me through to Apple. The guy said the only way to reset your passcode is to go to iTunes!  I said I did that already. He said for an iphone, you need to reset it until the apple with the cord shows on the phone and press recover. I said I plugged it into the laptop, it clocked. I turned the iPhone on and off while plugged into the laptop and it still did not work. I did it several times. He said I can't see what update you had. I said yes you can. Your Apple then said goodbye. 
I could not get to an Apple store until 8pm same night 10 miles away due to previous plans. The phone started working right when I walked in. It took the thumb print and the screen showed. The guy there said it was probably updating. I walked out of the store a few steps and decided to try the software update that originally caused this mess. Sure enough it would not take the passcode and I was locked out again. I walked back in to the Apple store. I told a young woman working there the issue with the software update not taking my passcode. She said I would have to make an appointment and there is nothing available until next week!  I said no. 
Apple is the one who sent the software upgrade causing my phone to be locked out and now useless. She said their not authorized to change a passcode. I said Verizon blames Apple and Apple blames Verizon. She said I know how you feel. I said Do you? She said I could talk to Apple support on the phone. I said No.  I already did that. That's why I'm here. She said due to the holidays, we have a higher volume and I can't get you in until next week. I said I'm not the one who caused this, Apple did and between you and Verizon I still don't have a phone that works. I walked out. This is unacceptable. They should've taken me that night. They need an accountability and make up for the stress they caused me and right before the holidays. 
Biltmore Apple fixed the problem by resetting the phone the next morning. And yes, they fixed the problem with the passcode even though the young woman at Arrowhead Apple said she Apple was not authorized. Liar.",2017-12-22 19:37:35

588,1103,,"I want Yelp to establish some serious ground rules in regards to buffets.

If you're a woman and weigh less than 150 pounds and you're a man and you weigh less than 185 pounds, you are not allowed to write buffet reviews. Seriously. Maybe Yelp should include a ""Do you weigh less than 150/185 pounds"" as an additional business tip when it comes time to review buffets. Hating on a buffet because you because you don't like the general ""quality"" of the food is like a fat guy (like me) hating on a tapas restaurant because I don't like the ""quantity"" of the food. 

Maybe Yelp should include a ""Do you weigh more than 150/185 pounds"" as an additional tip if you eat at a tapas-style restaurant? 

Enough ranting. All I can say is that Golden Corral is a slightly more expensive, but higher quality (in terms of food) buffet than Hometown Buffet. I like Hometown's seating arrangement better with it's ample amount of booths whereas Golden Corral seems satisfied to be primarily tables to get the customer in and out. As with all buffets, only order water as a drink so you can chow down more and don't forget to bring cash to tip the bussers/drink servers because there's no option to tip at the register.",2014-02-07 21:17:23

I thought the $1 Roulette tables were enticing, but there is only 1 wheel for 2 tables so it took foreverrrrr. It's an OK place to stop by if you still want to gamble but don't have enough money left to play the higher stakes table games at the casinos right next door.

First time was like 3 star experience... decent amount of beers on tap and solid happy hour food list. The bartender was a chick who was cute and was able to shoot the shit with us pretty well, I was impressed.

The look and decor of the place is impressive and swanky, reminds me of back home in LA. 

As I was ready to leave, it was pretty busy, and there was a huge group of older guys. Above average first experience.

The second time was on a Saturday a couple weeks ago and my buddies wanted to check out a cool spot for food and drinks in Scottsdale so I took them here and it ended up being a good call.

For lunch, this place is awesome as we got to sit outside on the couches, got some GREAT cocktails (not cheap though) and my Pork Belly was really good.

1st experience 3 stars, nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either.

I ordered the combo fajitas which was $25. Unfortunately the food is extremely lacking. Every meal ordered by our party of 9 was disappointing. My meats were bland and flavor less. One of my groups mentioned that my steaks were beef jerky. The food quality wouldn't have been so bad if the prices weren't so unbelievably high for the food. I wouldn't return to this location.

The food was also very good, chips with pulled pork sandwich, the portion was reasonable (I hate when the plate is monstruously covered with food, and this burger was exactly the right size). Also had a nacho plate with friends.

My only downside was the selection of food. I wished there were just a few more options to choose from. Not a 5 page menu, but just something like 5-6 more items.",2014-07-08 13:48:32
746,326,,"I was having some repairs done to my vehicle and they offered me the loaner, so I decided to get a long overdue pedi. I searched Yelp and came across this salon. I got right in and Kelly was my technician. She was excellent! Anticipated my needs, she was efficient, and courteous. I picked a design out of the photo album and asked for a different color. After an initial application she suggested another shade of the color so it would show up better, and I'm happy she did. 
As I got into the car, my foot got caught under the peddle and smudged my big toe! Ugh! It was so perfect too. I walked back in and explained what happened and they fixed it, like new! I will be happy to return!  Thank you!!!",2017-03-04 00:37:14
1512,69,,"Pretty good ....
I ordered takeout, which took a long time because I think the bartender forgot to put in my order. You can watch what's going on in the wide open kitchen. Staff was standing around, getting ready for the next rush. No takeout was being packed until I asked a few times where my food was.
I've had the Caesar at Guy's place in Bakersfield, which was much better. This was a bit on the soggy side with too much dressing. Needed some fresh, cracked pepper.
I got the Sammy recommended by the bartender as his fave dish on the menu, the Motley Que. I really liked this pulled pork delight on a pretzel bun with coleslaw. Maybe a teensy sweet/spicy BBQ sauce would amp it up? I pulled the unmelted, greasy cheese off. Yuck. Ooh, not interested! Still, sandwich is really good. The assorted fries were on the hard side, and the seasoning is a little much. It came with a whole dill pickle. Mine seemed to already have a bite out of it. Hmmmm ...?
One last note ... Most of the takeout packaging was nice. I think they buy the cheapest cutlery kit you can buy..... White, medium weight polypropylene. Thin, one ply napkin included. This is about the cheapest you can buy. They spend a lot on the nice bag, a little on the takeout boxes and portion cups, and skimp big time on the cutlery kit.
Net net = pretty good. Liked my last meals at Burro Boracho Rio (Laughlin and Vegas) and Bakersfield better.",2016-07-14 06:43:27

Can't go wrong with the cold sesame noodles.  Beef roll was also scrumptious. 
Dan Dan noodles didn't contain one grain of pork, though not advertised as such, I generally get some pork love in my Dan Dan.  Noods arrived quite mushy, hence why I preferred the cold sesame.
Potstickers arrive in a way that I had not seen before - cooked as a sheet and with a crisp bottom - fascinating idea, but it prevented us from cleanly separating the dumplings from the rest, so filling got torn out.
Veggie dumplings were stuffed with mealy, pureed - turnip, maybe?  Felt like it would definitely be adored by the kiddos, but it ached for some seasoning.",2018-07-17 00:48:10

619,514,,"When you picture a stereotypical version of the Irish, what do you see?

Men of every size and shape standing around, holding a pint of Guinness (or Smithwick's or Boddingtons) in one hand, the other draped around some other bloke's neck, singing--nay, YELL-singing at the top of their lungs to ""Danny Boy."" Beer is sloshed about, there's laughing, kissing, the works--while it's balls-cold outside.

Right? Am I right? You know I'm right.

This is almost identical to what happens at Nine Fine Irishmen (except outside, you have the desert). There's someone on the piano, singing on the mike, while the drunkards try to one-up the poor sod with their drunken renditions of Irish-y versions of American pop songs.

And as much as I detest karaoke and annoying drunkards, sometimes it's fun to partake in both ventures. Nine Fine Irishmen offers this opportunity, in addition to their excellent whisky selection and standard pub fare.

I dedicate my 400th Yelp review to you, Nine Fine Irishmen. And here's to hoping that next time I visit, I don't call you ""Three Drunk Irishmen, or whatever that bar's called.""",2012-10-12 19:37:01
1386,291,,"Early December, 2017, a software update showed in my phone settings under General, software update. On 12-21-17 I went into the settings to process the update. It had a bug in it. It wouldn't take my numeric passcode I use daily on the home screen. Same day approx lunch time, I called Verizon who took my monthly payment over the phone then had me reset the passcode in settings to the same passcode. It did not work and I was now locked out of my phone. I could not dial out - only emergencies.  I couldn't call Verizon or anyone. I used my iPad and went online to Verizon and got Zack on chat. I told him I just got off the phone with Verizon who locked my phone and how could Verizon fix it. He asked me where I changed my passcode. I said the settings screen. He said he could not help me and sent me a link for passcodes to work.  
The link says to go to itunes, plug your phone in and click 'recover.'  I plugged it it into my laptop. A message came up on my laptop asking to allow to connect to my iPhone. I clicked yes or allow. It clocked then came up with an error message that it could not connect to the phone. The phone never showed a message on the locked screen to connect to the laptop. I turned the phone off and on. Nothing happened. It still would not take my passcode. 
I immediately left for the nearest verizon store on 7th Street and Bell Road. 
I told a guy there was a software update that would not take my passcode on that screen. I told him I called verizon about an hour ago who had me reset my passcode to the same one and now I'm locked out of my phone. He blamed Apple and said Verizon is not responsible for Apple. He said you need to call Apple or go to an Apple store. I said I need to cancel my account then. He said I couldn't cancel my phone in the store. Your going to have to call verizon. I said with a phone that doesn't work?  He said you can use a phone here. I called verizon and told them the same issue. They blamed Apple. I said if Apple can't fix this, I'm going to cancel my account. She put me through to Apple. The guy said the only way to reset your passcode is to go to iTunes!  I said I did that already. He said for an iphone, you need to reset it until the apple with the cord shows on the phone and press recover. I said I plugged it into the laptop, it clocked. I turned the iPhone on and off while plugged into the laptop and it still did not work. I did it several times. He said I can't see what update you had. I said yes you can. Your Apple then said goodbye. 
I could not get to an Apple store until 8pm same night 10 miles away due to previous plans. The phone started working right when I walked in. It took the thumb print and the screen showed. The guy there said it was probably updating. I walked out of the store a few steps and decided to try the software update that originally caused this mess. Sure enough it would not take the passcode and I was locked out again. I walked back in to the Apple store. I told a young woman working there the issue with the software update not taking my passcode. She said I would have to make an appointment and there is nothing available until next week!  I said no. 
Apple is the one who sent the software upgrade causing my phone to be locked out and now useless. She said their not authorized to change a passcode. I said Verizon blames Apple and Apple blames Verizon. She said I know how you feel. I said Do you? She said I could talk to Apple support on the phone. I said No.  I already did that. That's why I'm here. She said due to the holidays, we have a higher volume and I can't get you in until next week. I said I'm not the one who caused this, Apple did and between you and Verizon I still don't have a phone that works. I walked out. This is unacceptable. They should've taken me that night. They need an accountability and make up for the stress they caused me and right before the holidays. 
Biltmore Apple fixed the problem by resetting the phone the next morning. And yes, they fixed the problem with the passcode even though the young woman at Arrowhead Apple said she Apple was not authorized. Liar.",2017-12-22 19:37:35

1. My wife nearly spat out the ice tea.
2. My daughter's drink was so disgusting I ran into the bathroom to spit it out after tasting. I made her dump it for another. The cashier mentioned they changed the type of soda in the machine, but any good restaurant would at least flush the system.
3. The steak in my dish, even though I had it chopped, was tough. Some of it was inedible.
4. The salsa, while spicy, completely lacked character. It was just soupy spiciness.
5. The rice and beans were half decent.
6. The atmosphere was dull, uninspired and completely empty on a Sunday evening.
7. It cost $30 to feed two adults and two kids, which is about the same price we would spend at Chipotle. Not a real bargain from my standpoint.

The night before, after clubbing at Tao and Tryst, we came here for our after clubbing munchies!  I ordered the pasta with chicken, sundried tomatoes and mushroom.  It was quite bland when I had it.

I've been to the other location in Rancho and even the menu items are different. Missing quite a few necessities like , , and . To top it all off a lot of the menu items were sold out.

Everyone I knew absolutely RAVED about this place, so one evening, my family and I went. The service was awful, the food was cold, and they brought me out food with an allergen on it (which I SPECIFICIALLY told the server about). We chalked it up to the thought that this place is known for breakfast, and we were there in the evening. Our fault; let's try again in the morning sometime.

So we did. Again... epic failure. The service was terrible, the food was mediocre, and we had to ask repeatedly for someone to even bring our drinks  (yes, that's part of service, but deserves its own mention). It's been a few months now, but I just can't see going back.

Nothing special and certainly not worth the $100 price take for 4 entrees. For example the pecan pie French toast was $14 and it was literally three slices of bread layered with a smushed piece of pie...very underwhelming.

I don't even like collard greens that much but I'll share a serving from Mert's. 

Fried chicken always done just right, salmon cakes tasty and slightly spicy. The remoulade sauce is a killer. It's even good on the chicken.

Cons: menu is confusing and ""building your own combo"" takes a hot minute to figure out. Are we in a Boba place or a milkshake place or a Waffle place? Are we better at breakfast or lunch? Slightly confusing.  Bathroom is dingy, maybe just unkept?, and waffle wasn't hot when served (butter-didn't-melt unhot). Brand feels a little confused somewhere between fast food and mom and pop diner. Fancy waffle around $7-$9 (for just the waffle). Syrup was thin and sweet, not very maple-y, as I had hoped for a waffle place. If you just order a simple waffle with syrup, I think you'd be disappointed. Pros: fruit bowl came with fresh mangos, pineapples and blueberries (amazing fruit bowl). Sandwiches and kids meal come with side/drink. ""Coffee bar"" and hot sauce bar had nice assortment. Most enjoyable was A.J. She greeted us, took our order and was incredibly friendly and informative. She saved our experience, which dependent on the food/cost, wasn't overly impressive.  We ordered mostly breakfast items and if we were to return might try the lunch/brunch items. I have a feeling those might be stronger than the breakfast items we ordered.",2018-05-03 04:24:07

1902,955,,"This place is the real deal. Great service and atmosphere. I first went here about 6-months ago while I was in LV for business. Huge selection of IPAs and wine --- I knocked down a couple of the Imperial IPAs and at 8.9% alcohol, they took the edge off after a long day, haha. 

Menu is loaded with every type of pizza and Italian dish --- Chicago style, New York, thin crust, gluten free, etc. etc. etc. --- it took me forever to decide but I finally settled on the Carne Totiro and was absolutely delicious. 

I went back with a few buddies last month and we were not disappointed. We ordered one of their larger pies, loaded with meat and veggies and we couldn't finish. Great way to start the night!

If you're in DTLV and you're looking for a solid place to eat, drink, watch sports and people watch --- Pizza Rock is an awesome option. I do not travel to LV often but I will definitely make it a point to hit this place up again when I back in the city.",2015-11-11 17:31:05
46,44,,"Had a fantastic experience dining at Olive & Ivy! Believe it or not, we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the August Scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well.

Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed! 

I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate! 

The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an ""ice cream bar,"" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.

Olive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!",2013-08-03 15:44:57

551,631,,"Decent restaurant, nothing really special.

I had the Steak Frites. The Steak was seasoned pretty well, and the butter on top really didn't add anything. The butter was seasoned by some dried basil, though the flavour didn't really contribute to the steak overall

The steak was oozing out juices, this meant the chefs didn't care enough to let the meat rest for 5 minutes, this left me pretty disappointed and it was very messy to eat because of it.

I liked the frites texture, it was perfectly crisp on the outside an so fluffy on the inside, but the problem was it was WAYYYYYYYYYYY too salty. I had to drink a cup of water with every 1 fry I ate. Another problem was the crispy texture I really liked on the fries disappeared when steak juices oozed out and made all the fries soggy

2. Lots of menu options. Whether you like turkey burgers, veggie burgers, a paleo burger, or shake, this is your stop. 

3. Friendly staff. The service is great. 

4. The food is really good. Especially the onion rings and the shake. 

Cons:

1. restroom is kind of nasty. 

2. Because the food is so good...the line is long.

In a nice little very clean shopping area (the restaurant was packed but they text you when a table is ready so having the nice shopping area to walk around helps).

876,193,,"Wow. Wow Freakin' Wow.

I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER. 

I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.

I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.

When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!

The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.

We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.

But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.

Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.

For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.

Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) 

It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.

Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through. 

The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)

There were three of us.  We had the fried calamari, baby beet salad, grilled shrimp risotto, orechiette with lobster and shrimp and the short ribs with spinach gnocchi.  All the dishes were excellently prepared and flavorful.

The fried calamari reminded me of the way my mother makes them.  Perfectly cooked and a very light batter.  Salad was delicious with just right amount of dressing.  
Risotto was well prepared with great flavor from the shrimp and hint of lemon.  
The orechiette was prepared al dente with a light red sauce infused with the lobster and shrimp.  Yummy!
The short ribs were melt in your mouth tender with gnocchi that were very light in texture.

Will definitely return to try other dishes.",2014-05-08 21:48:03

I went vintage (I suppose) on the first try and had the Ricky Bobby (Talladega Nights is one of my favs so that's pretty much why) and I loved it. One thing that I personally wasn't a fan of and that was the onion rings. I like onion rings and I expected to enjoy it mixed with the BBQ sauce and the epic meat.....I didn't really enjoy it. I know that's probably one of the things that MAKES the sandwich, but the next time I get it, I think I'm gonna get it sans onion rings. Everything else was really good.

Not only that, no FAQ on their site that mentions it's a fire safety hazard before booking. I have definitely stayed at a nicer hotel in Vegas with the same room size with 2 queens and been able to have a roll away. 

Instead the concierge offers that a member of my family can sleep very comfortably on the floor. So why are we staying at this hotel again if we have to take turns sleeping on the floor? I'm not sure. I could have gotten us two rooms each with 2 queen beds for the holiday pricing I paid, elsewhere. 

And no, we didn't over pack the room, we have 4 people total. 2 on one bed, 1 on another and now one on the floor/couch. Not to mention our rooms were right over the club. Bass bumping.

For the work done, I got a fill and shape change while my boyfriend got the paraffin spa pedi.

Hailee did my nails and I'd have to say I am loving it! I can't stop looking at them. It seems pretty simple but I do love the detail. It's like a pinky nude marble design. I saw that Hailee did way more work on my nails compared to other nail shops. The result? Perfectly shaped nails! I honestly feel like the next time I go again, I might just ask her to do whatever she feels like because her work is amazing!

As for the pedicure, my boyfriend loved it and felt they really try to make you feel comfortable. In the end, he was completely satisfied with his feet feeling like a baby's butt!

Overall, I feel like this place puts in a lot of effort and pays attention to detail. The workers are really sweet and patient. We definitely will be returning.

Update: After a few weeks, about 3 of my acrylics started coming off and others were being chipped. I was so disappointed as I loved them at first, but this was the first time it has happened to me.

998,413,,"NOTE TO YELPERS: 3 Stars doesn't mean that something is bad. People give out praise FAR TO EASILY and are overly harsh ALL THE TIME on here, so let's all make  more of an effort to be honest with our reviews.

First time I've been to one of the much talked about Las Vegas buffet's! After hearing that a co-worker of my wife's raved about it and a friend of ours that actually lives in Vegas say that it's definitely one of the best, I was pretty excited about eating here. We decided to drive down instead of walking or taking a cab. Trust me when I say, don't take a cab, just drive if you really wanna get there in a hurry. The Self Parking at the Cosmo is an absolute piece of cake. Well, enough about The Cosmo and more about Wicked Spoon!

Perhaps I was ill informed about cost, because I went in thinking it was gonna be around $50 for two people. Oh no, it was $75! Granted this was New Years Eve and everything in Vegas seems much more expensive this time of year, but at this price I was seriously hoping that I was going to be blown away. 

We got in line and it moved fairly quickly, this is big spot and either due to the time of day or the fact that they have so many tables it just seemed to be a ten minute wait in line (if it was even that long). We were brought to our table and we both ordered orange juice. I would've liked a mimosa, but I didn't realize it was extra to get alcohol. Granted, that is entirely my mistake, but it would've been nice if they said something before we went in. 

The most important part is, of course, the food. It is without a doubt the best buffet I've ever been to! The stand outs had to have been the smoked salmon, the green beans, the fried chicken and the ramen noodles. Oh and the duck confit ravioli would've absolutely been killer, but I didn't like the cinnamon on it, just a little too sweet. The portions are just right, as you're able to sample a bunch of different foods without over doing it on the actual intake side of things. 

Would I go back? Probably not. Not that it isn't good by any means, it is. It's an above average breakfast and a great buffet. I just know that there is better food in Vegas and that I've had better breakfasts plenty of times in my life.",2012-12-31 22:11:41

Location: Just a hop, skip and a jump from Redrock Casino (10-15 minute drive) that takes you back into another time and place.  It's located in beautiful Redrock Canyon... just head west on Charleston Blvd and turn right when you see the sign for Bonnie Springs Ranch.

Bonnie Springs Ranch: has all sorts of fun things to do and you can easily spend several hours here.  There are 2 dirt parking lots (FREE) and if you park in the 1st large lot you can catch the cute little train for a 5 minute ride to the entrance area.  The 2nd lot is small and is located right in front of the entrance. There is the rustic cowboy style restaurant with a nice warm fire when you enter. 
Train Ride:  Cute, fun and Free
Horseback Riding:  I think it's around $60/hour per person. 
Zombie Shoot & Ghost Tours:  Each of these takes place one Saturday evening per month... They are both kind of pricey and we did not do these.

Bonnie Springs Restaurant:  Very Good!! The menu is classic American Food with Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.  I had the Bonnie Springs burger with Corn on the Cob instead of fries. My  burger was perfectly cooked,  juicy and it came with Swiss cheese and bacon. It was served on toasted buttered sourdough bread and it was delicious!  It wasn't cheap but it is well worth the price.  They also have buffalo burgers and sometimes Elk too! The service was excellent and our waitress was friendly and saw to our needs for refills and keeping the table cleared.  Be sure to walk the grounds if you're here during the day and at no charge you'll see all sorts of animals such as their bull, ducks, peacocks, turtles and roosters.

Two tiny pieces of celery were included. I also had a side of fries, which were good, but not very crispy. It was a very good lunch.

the food was awesome too. i had the loup de mer (a fish dish), and it was awesome. i know it seems odd not to order a steak at a steakhouse, but due to many reasons i decided that loup de mer is my best choice and i had no regret. it was just the best pan roasted fish i had in 2017. i love fish so it was really a wise and awesome choice for me. 10/10 on the fish.
my husband ordered the 10 oz prime rib special they offered for christmas time. He absolutely loved it and said it was the best he had too. He gave me a piece to taste and it was very soft and tender. my husband had it served as medium well and it was still soft. so you can picture how great this prime rib was. 10/10 again on the prime rib.
Lastly we finished with a dessert, which is poached pear with oat walnut crumbles, and a scoop of ginger ice cream. this whole combination was very tasty, fresh and delicate. another 10/10. 

we are very happy with the entire meal. we were never rushed to order dessert or finishing up even when we were the last table left at the end. it was inpressive that the staff were all so nice even when working on a holiday.

At our third appointment we saw a Nurse Midwife and though she seemed very rushed and the 12 week appointment was not like I expected, our personality clicked and I scheduled my next appointment with her also - Belinda, love the accent!

My reservation is with their Ultrasound Technician. I do not know her name as she has never introduced herself. Our 1st ultrasound was at 8 weeks and happened so fast. As soon as she found the baby she froze the screen, took a measurement, then unfroze the screen and immediately moved away from the baby to look for my ovaries. From all the women I have spoken to that have visited this office had the opportunity to watch their little raspberry flutter around. In all, it took under 5 minutes and I felt exactly like Rachel Green from Friends (I can't see it!!!). At our next appointment I had declined the genetic testing for Down's Syndrome because I am not as risk but requested to have an ultrasound performed. Front desk made the appointment and then when they confirmed it they reminded me to drink my fluid because of the ultrasound. Day of 12 week Ultrasound (so excited!) we get called back by the same technician - whom obviously DOES NOT review medical records because she asked if this was our first baby again and if this was our first ultrasound. We informed her that yes it is our first and that no we had one performed at 8 weeks, so she had me get on the table and said they'd be doing genetic testing. My husband stopped her and told her we declined the genetic test and she states, ""Then we're not doing an ultrasound."" I told her we were under the impression that we could still have it done even if we were required to pay out of pocket and she replies, ""We are a Medical Facility, we do not do things here for fun. There are other places for things like that and I will not perform an ultrasound without Doctor orders."" It took everything in me to not cry and I know it took everything that is Holy to prevent my husband from snapping at this lady. We were so shocked at her rude reaction to our request and she immediately starts asking who told us we could, who scheduled the appointment, ect. I told her I didn't remember because I wasn't aware I needed to keep track of every person I speak to at that office (although now I will be) and she told us to go back to the waiting room. As we were leaving her room she YELLS for her manager to get into her room, probably to complain about what just happened. Aside from the fact that we were never made aware of their policy on ""fun VS medical"", she handled all wrong. She is obviously burnt out on prenatal care and the fragile emotions expectant mothers - specially first time mothers - have because she did not take our feelings into consideration at all. I am going to request to NOT have her perform any more ultrasounds and if she is their only technician I will be informing them that they will no longer be performing ours - if that doesn't jive with their ""procedure"" then we unfortunatley will be finding a new office.

And on top of all of that they sent me a bill for what my responsibility was after insurance that was $150 MORE than what my insurance said I owed. When I brought in all my EOB's and their bill the ""biller"" said, ""We're probably still pending payment and that's why your bill from us is much higher. Plus we try to collect for all global services prior to you giving birth."" Fortunately she collected what my insurance said I owed and not what her system said. I'm going to have to watch them like a  hawk.",2015-04-17 22:40:28

  Oh Marquee, how I wish I could live in Vegas just to visit you once a week :) :)  Just thinking about your great music/lights/feeling/pool make me want to skip work and head out to vegas again!  We were a group of 5 girls, 1 guy (gay) and it was a Friday night.  I had put our party on the guestlist the week before online.  They didn't actually email me about the guestlist until that day, but that's alright, we got in just fine.  No fee for girls, our guy was $25, not bad.  We got there before 11pm, probably around 10pm.  Don't be late!  We got in and started dancing immediately!  It was great!  We were right in front of the DJ booth.  I got some awesome pictures too because the lights go on and off during the dancing and they're different colors, mostly red, so the red light on people's faces looks great (keep the flash off)!  
  One of the best parts of Marquee is the outside.  There is a little bit of seating around the planters for the girls whose feet are killing them.  The cabanas outside are really cool and people looked like they were having a great time in them :)  There's a great bar outside too that never got too crowded so you can order your drinks quickly :)  
  Overall it was awesome!  One of the top 2 clubs in Vegas for sure.  This one and XS!  You can't go wrong!  Next time I'll try Surrender too.  Trust the reviews!",2012-06-26 00:24:34

It's this huge butter cake and it's awesome! So get that and save room for it! Actually, maybe skip the steak and just get that! That's the only thing I would come back here for.

Great, friendly and prompt service, essential when you are travelling with kids :-)

But the food, the food is why we were there.

All I can say is wow.  WOW. My wife ordered the Moules, red curry sauce; and we thought it was good, damn good, until I tried my Carbonnade Flamade.  Beef braised in Belgian brown ale.  WOW.  Mouthwatering good.  I love you but I am *not* sharing this with you, good. Paired with a Chimay Blanche, I was in heaven.

I have heard of Point Brugge for some time and never managed to get around there until tonight.  I will be going back, and soon.

To be clear, this is not a 5-star restaurant.  You can probably get better food elsewhere.  But, this is a simple concept delivered very well.  The atmosphere is very homely, comfortable and inviting.  The service friendly and efficient.  The food met or exceeded my expectations, and these were set pretty high.

(When I later got into my bay, one of the bays next to us was passing a flask around.) That didn't give me a very good first impression of the business and I hadn't even made it in the door yet. 

I ordered a membership card online prior to arriving because I was told that it would be easier than waiting in line to buy one there. I still had to wait in line to pick it up and when I did, they had no record of my purchase. When I showed them my receipt email on my phone, the receipt that was sent to me was for another person. I spoke with a manager and forwarded him the emails so that he could send it to corporate to investigate. Safe to say, I'm a bit nervous that they can't keep receipts straight in email I'm worried about them having my credit card information.

Cons: menu is confusing and ""building your own combo"" takes a hot minute to figure out. Are we in a Boba place or a milkshake place or a Waffle place? Are we better at breakfast or lunch? Slightly confusing.  Bathroom is dingy, maybe just unkept?, and waffle wasn't hot when served (butter-didn't-melt unhot). Brand feels a little confused somewhere between fast food and mom and pop diner. Fancy waffle around $7-$9 (for just the waffle). Syrup was thin and sweet, not very maple-y, as I had hoped for a waffle place. If you just order a simple waffle with syrup, I think you'd be disappointed. Pros: fruit bowl came with fresh mangos, pineapples and blueberries (amazing fruit bowl). Sandwiches and kids meal come with side/drink. ""Coffee bar"" and hot sauce bar had nice assortment. Most enjoyable was A.J. She greeted us, took our order and was incredibly friendly and informative. She saved our experience, which dependent on the food/cost, wasn't overly impressive.  We ordered mostly breakfast items and if we were to return might try the lunch/brunch items. I have a feeling those might be stronger than the breakfast items we ordered.",2018-05-03 04:24:07
601,884,,"I am not a Wynn or a spa type of person by any means of the imagination.  Up until I was about fifteen all I knew of Las Vegas was the Circus Circus trailer park where my parents parked our camper while they went to gamble away my college savings and I was left feeding the chipmunks that lived in the bushes, tossing them palomitas de maiz from a giant tin of 6-year-old Christmas popcorn (three flavors).

But I digress.

Compared to the spa at Mandalay Bay, I feel like the one at the Wynn is better kept up, warmer, and cozier.  For $30 you get access to the gym, showers, sauna, eucalyptus steam room, jacuzzi and plunge pools, and one of those drenching shower things that the kids seem to enjoy nowadays.  The amenities include all your toiletries, fluffy robe, spa sandals, iced towels, regular towels, bottled water, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, ice water, lots of magazines and newspapers, and headphones for the workout machines.  There is a nice chillout room with a T.V., couches, and fireplace.  The staff is nice, not too chirpy, which is good.

As someone else mentioned in the reviews here, if you just want to work out, having to pay $30 is annoying as hell.  But if you allow yourself some time to enjoy the facilities, it's a nice treat overall.  I've been here three times, at different times of the day and evening, on weekdays and weekends, and it never seems to get particularly crowded.  So enjoy.",2009-02-09 03:48:43

If you sit at the bar, there is a huge pillar with a flat screen, which is great for watching sports, but hides you away from the bartender if you sit to the righthand side.  
I had to get up and get his attention because he couldn't see me.
The girl that sat down next to me actually moved to one of the tables in the lounge because the service was so bad (she did get great service from the cocktail waitress though).

The Wild Mushroom soup was amazing, that is why the restaurant gets a star.  Have the soup, then go somewhere else for the main course.

The steak I ordered was tasteless, I had to order a side of bearnaise sauce to get it down and I love steak; I would eat steak everyday if I could, but not from here even if it was free (which it definately wasn't).  And the bearnaise was tasteless as well.  If I hadn't enjoyed the soup so much I would have thought something was wrong with my sense of taste.

The wine also tasted like it had been opened the day before or maybe even the day before that.  I'm not a wine snob, but it was like vinegar.  The bartender didn't even bother pouring a little for himself to see if it had gone bad.

I wasn't sure what to eat either halibut or Mahi Mahi. I was gonna look on yelp but my phone died!!! No!!! Well I asked the waiter and he said the halibut. I Was so disappointed because the HALIBUT was SOOOOO DRY and no flavor at all. But the side of corn I got was amazing. Over all I would give it a 3 1/2 stars because of the bad recommendation by waiter.,2015-09-04 20:38:55

Be weary that if you break any of their unlisted ""rules"" they give you dirty looks until they get the courage to tell you what's bothering them.

My sister was here studying and I decided to surprise her with dinner. I decided to buy a drink and as I paid, the owner says, ""whatever you guys are eating, next time take it outside to eat.""

The second I sat down, a young lady told my sister, ""you need to take your food outside.""

...? Yes...we got it, no food.

I wasn't aware I couldn't bring outside food. Ok, my bad? But no need to say it rudely. You provide this atmosphere where people stay for long periods of time catching up or studying and you get angry for people sticking around? It's not like I wasn't giving them business by buying something. 

Something that was supposed to be a sweet surprise ended up being a bad experience.

The rooms are fine.  They are not the best.  The TV's haven't been replaced in a while and you can tell since they are not flat screen.

The people cleaning the rooms were very sweet and gave me a new set of towels even though I had a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign up.  I met her in the hallway and made an exchange.  Towels for a few dollars tip which she thanked me for.

I do want to try the buffet card you can get.  It's less than $50 AND you can go to 7 buffets under the Harrah's umbrella for 24 hours.  I didn't get to do it this time because I knew I had to go to dinner at a Cafe de Lux within the 24 hours I was in town, thus making the card less valuable.

I don't know if the guy at the door is the owner or not, I am assuming so as he seems to be the heart and soul of the operation. He was friendly, talkative and made you feel like part of the family and he appreciated you being there. 

You could see the food being made and the whole kitchen staff. The kitchen staff reminded me of gents fresh out of the pen, however they worked hard, looked like they appreciated having a job, looked like they just belonged. I was thankful to them and thought they kicked butt. 

I come to Vegas 3-5 times a year from S. California. If I am alone then no doubt I go to Mr. Mamas at least 1 time for breakfast while I am there. If I can I work to talk friends into coming with me to Mr. Mamas.

693,446,,"visited this ""original"" location with friends from work.  atmosphere was decent.  if u are of ""darker"" complection, u get weird looks from other patrons.  i mean, we ""stood out"" a bit, but folks here are a bit obvious with their ""weird"" looks.  anyhow, I'm giving this place 3 stars and here's the breakdown:

food:  4 stars good portion size. that's if you stick to anything ""american"".  Example was a friend ordered the Tandoori Chicken plate... well, there's nothing Tandoori about it.  The chicken looked like they came off the grill (which is not how tandoori's are done) and had some spices thrown on top of it.  She didn't like it.  the bback ribs were excellent however.  Again if you stick to the ""american"" grub you'll be fine.  Another friend ordered the rib eye medium-well, it was a bit over done.

atmosphere:  3 stars.  decent typical bar scene in a college town/business district.  nothing spectacular but then again, you wouldn't expect anything more or anything less.

service:  1 star.  we had an extremely rude server who gave us attitude as soon as we sat down.  it appeared he was not happy about having out-of-town business type people because as soon as we asked for separate checks, he threw an attitude and was quite rude.  rolled his eyes a couple times!!! he was ""special"" and if you do visit this joint and get Eric as ur server, look out!!!

This place could have been better but again, if you can look pass the annoyances and focus on the food, you'll definitely like this place.

BTW, the microbrew was not too shabby.  the beer sampler was pretty good.

Air Canada's not bad -- I'd say that they compare well to a lot of the legacy airlines we have stateside, but Porter takes a page out of the JetBlue/Virgin America playbook and tries to offer something a bit nicer than usual and they deliver all around.

Sure, it's a little turboprop plane, but you do get a sweet lounge to hang out in while at Toronto City Airport and free (boozy) drinks in flight. 

Toronto City Airport is a pleasure to fly into and out of, with super-short customs lines on the way in and super-short security lines on the way out. The landing approach with a full view of the Toronto skyline is an nice bonus.

There's no inflight entertainment and the ride isn't quite as smooth, but the pre- and post-flight experience is more than enough to make up for that -- Porter will definitely be our airline of choice for future trips to Toronto.",2010-05-03 00:19:25

1113,181,,"This dump does not even deserve 1 star! I was looking forward to my second visit to Chipotle in my life and it happened to appear like a message from God after a long walk on the strip. The workers on the ""burrito"" line were great...except for the last two. One girl wrapped up your burrito in foil and the other wrote on them and prepared them for the cashier. The girl wrapping the burritos seemed like a robot and therefore didn't notice that every piece of pre-cut foil was a little too small to wrap the full burrito. This left a small 1/2 inch by 2 inch exposed area on the burrito. That's OK (I thought) as she finished wrapping, but then the retard flipped the burritio upside down and the next employee in line just slid the burrito down the counter to the cashier! SOOOO GROSS. You could tell they had a ""rhythm"" going as it was busy (as I'm sure it always is since it's on the strip). So once I told her there was no way in hell i was eating a burrito that had been slid on a counter all the way to the cashier, she seemed upset but ordered another burrito to be made right away. Then, I get to the cashier and order myself a Corona with my burrito. Corona pops on the counter but with a disgusting lime. It wasn't even a faint shade of green, it was brown and way squishy. Almost the consistency of playdoh. I'm not about to drink herpes in a bottle so I explained that the lime was near compost quality and the same lady that I complained about the burrito to went fishing in the lime bin. She came out with another lime that had a brown bruise on the skin and said ""They all look like that"" and I took it, because I am well aware of the bruising habits of limes in particular since Coronas are like water in my life. I could have debated on the difference between the first lime I received and the second, but I was hungry and really needed to start chugging the beer after my experience. Sorry for the INCONVENIENCE CHIPOTLE. I surely slowed down your process on that nice Saturday afternoon on the strip but why don't you serve SANITARY food.

Based on recommendations found here, I ordered the pollo fundido and was not disappointed. It was very good.

After all of this, are you wondering why the two-star review? It comes down to one thing. SALSA. It's not hard to make a simple, pleasant salsa. One can be a self-declared talent-less cook and still manage to produce a palatable salsa. With my salsa-addicted boyfriend and our history of always polishing off the salsa and chips provided with the meal, we left our table with three salsas remaining.

One was a tomatillo salsa.  It was probably the best of the three,...after adding a substantial amount of salt to it. (We were told the secret ingredient of this was iceberg lettuce.)

The second salsa had a weird underlying flavor to it, almost like paprika. It was just funky. (The secret ingredient of this concoction was dried pepper, which probably explains the smokey flavor it had.)

The third salsa was more like a mushy tomato sauce. It would be best paired with mozzarella sticks.  (This salsa, the house salsa, was made with canned tomatoes and garlic. That's it. Seriously?) 

For a Mexican restaurant that puts out good food, salsa of this poor quality is inexcusable and a little shocking.",2014-07-27 21:46:33

I've walked out several times because I was either forgotten or my food took over 30 minutes.  I've seen people get really upset over their food taking so long but the cooks are to blame for that, not their waiters.   

All in all, it's a great place to eat but extremely popular.  Anyone going there should realize this before hand.  If your food takes to long, tell the manager and he'll likely give you the meal for free ( reasonably long ), they've done it for me.

The bathroom was amazing with a huge tub, glass shower, two sinks, and LCD TV.  Oh yea, and of couse there is the toilet.  Durr.  The layout of the suite is perfect.  You walk in and there are two SUPER comfy beds with a big flat screen.  A few steps below is another section with a huge L shaped couch and another TV.  I also loved how you have a remote to draw the curtains and shades.  This is KEY when you are hungover in the morning and can't seem to get up.  One press of the button and the 11am sunlight streams into your bedroom and you can't help but wake up. :)

On top of the fabulous rooms, the hotel has so much to offer.  Fabulous shops, a fun gondola ride, and great restaurants.  I would definitely recommend staying at the Venetian.",2012-04-19 14:29:30

The plaintains were my favorite.

The building was laid out nice with nice decorations. Our table was pretty good. The bench cushions were  a little low for some of the older people in the group but our waitress was really nice and accommodating.  For such a large group, she did amazing. She got the orders right and was very attentive. 

I ordered the firecracker shrimp to start. It was so good. Seasoning was off the hook. Large serving for an appetizer. My beer was nice and cold also.  

I then ordered the fish tacos. I have been a little spoiled living in California I suppose. The tacos were okay. Not enough pop and flavor for me. I was looking for that citrus pop of freshness but it wasn't there. The tortillas were a little chewy. Food alone would have gotten them a three, but when you throw in the awesome service, you can't beat it. The waitress made a fresh pot of coffee for us and the DJ gave my daughter  a Bahama breeze pen.  Everyone loved their food and there were no complaints. Decent price for what you get. 
I would go back easily.",2015-04-11 17:19:01

Last time I came the chicken and waffles was so over cooked and gristly, also just not tasty at all.

And tonight I shared biscuits and gravy with a friend while waiting for our table at Native Tongues. 

First bite was ok.... Until we both looked at eachother with a sour face because the biscuit had this AWFUL bitter after taste. It tasted like having blood in your mouth when you bit your tongue. It tasted like maybe way too much baking soda? It was actually awful.

All of it is divine. A few of my personal favorites are the almond cupcakes (simply perfection), their cream filled punckis (sp? But it's all about the icing...) and their mini fruit tart (light and refreshing). Their pricing is hands down, without a doubt, the best in Pittsburgh and the surrounding area. 95% of the time, their staff has a kind word and a smile on their face, regardless of the gigantic lines of customers they face.

On the plus side, happy hour is decent at half price appetizers, free chips & salsa and cheap drinks. I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend. 

Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.

The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front. 

We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food. 

Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Service was horrible, but they didn't even seem that busy.

One big difference compared to some mom and pop coffee places in the city is that they make their own syrups. I'm IN LOVE with the coconut syrup! The only challenges I've ever had are finding a (good) table [it's very small and popular location so space is at a premium, especially if it's too cold or hot to sit outside] and parking.

Sur place, nous constatons que l'endroit est minuscule. Les tables et les chaises sont petites, et notre table était sale, il y avait encore de la sauce dessus. J'ai moi-même pris un napkin pour essayer la table! 

Cet endroit est très bien pour connaître les gens; mon voisin de table qui est un parfait étranger était à 10 cm de moi et je pouvais tout suivre de sa conversation avec son ami. 
Après quelques minutes, la serveuse vient prendre la commande; j'opte pour une petite poutine à la sauce poivrée. 
Le service est un peu long, mais les poutines arrivent finalement. 
Les frites ne semblent pas très fraîches et sont un peu mordantes sous la dent, pas très bien cuites. 
Le goût est bien, rien d'extraordinaire; j'ai connu des poutines meilleures ailleurs! 
Ne voulant pas nous arrêter sur une note négative, nous décidons d'essayer les desserts.
Ce ne fût pas vraiment un succès. Le pudding chômeur était sec et un peu granuleux sous la dent, et le gâteau triple chocolat goûtait un peu le congelé, on sentait parfaitement le goût de l'humidité de congélateur à chaque bouchée. 
Alors que nous attendions l'addition, nous remarquons que le sol est bien sale. 
Mais au moins la facture n'était pas très élevée, ca il faut bien leur donner!

The pool area is not cleaned on a daily, or even every other day basis.  The attention to detail, for some reason, stops when you get to the pool.
Like I said in my last review, which I was told would be passed to those in charge, and I'll ask again... why wouldn't you take the time to clean one of the most important facets left at this property?  A team should be onsite every morning before it opens, going over it with a fine tooth comb.  This is your one chance to impress and keep this property the 4+ star it should be.

I've added photos of the lemons that sat on the same rock for 3 days, and as of now, are still sitting there.  Purchase a few bathing suits and send your crew into areas that can't otherwise be reached. Just don't let trash lay there because someone is too lazy to attempt to reach it.

777,1037,,"Family friendly hotel with lots of attractions for children, pool and slides, free circus shows on the hour (10 minutes each), and a theme park within. 

I give it four stars because it's the only family friendly hotel on the strip. Quality wise the hotel is old, smelly and crowded. The worse thing about it is you have ever to walk through the gaming areas to get anywhere, which means you have to inhale a lot of second hand smoke. 

If you could put up with these down sides, it's pretty decent considering the family stuff,big rooms and great price. Lots of couples and singles stay here because of the price and being in the strip.

Though it's on the strip, it's a distance away from the ""main"" strop. A good twenty minutes walk to Bellagio, that's like an hour in 100 plus heat! However, the good news is gets a bus stop right in front and you dun have to stand in the sun to wait for it too. Buy a day or three day bus pass and you'll be right with this hotel. Day pass is $8 and $20 for 3 days. Absolutely worthwhile, as you'll be tires from waking between casinos and shows and malls and buffets. Save ur energy by bussing around.",2017-08-16 05:46:14

I have never written a negative review before, I usually chalk it up to someone having a bad day.  I have worked in customer service for 10+ years and I know it is exhausting and bad days happen.  But this is a special occasion.

I was shocked and just stood there put my watch away awkwardly and left with no one else saying a word to me.

My family and I were very pleased with our dinner experience at Joe's. We were seated in a private dining room with a table that sits up to 12.  Our servers were very helpful and accommodating. 

For starters we got Joe's Chopped salad, which reminded me of a Greek salad with black olives and feta cheese, and the octopus salad. 

We got the porterhouse and rib eye steak. They were evenly charred and cooked perfectly to a medium temp. The Alaskan crab legs are a must! They were the biggest and most succulent crab legs I've ever had. I was tempted to order another 1.5 pounds of it.  We also loved the seared scallops, cooked perfectly!

The first time I went here (with my husband and kids in tow), I didn't realize that there was very limited seating, so be prepared to take out. In warm weather, it gets very hot inside the restaurant due to the ovens, so you may not want to sit inside anyway. There are a couple of benches outside on the sidewalk that people sit at to eat. Also, sometimes there is a long wait time, so call early. We usually order and bring it home, pop it onto a pizza stone and heat it back up. Still delicious and worth the drive for us.

The service is always friendly and they are always happy to answer questions about toppings, ingredients, etc.

The meats here are truly outstanding. Brisket was amazing...great crusty bark and beautiful smoke ring on the tender beef. The pork ribs have to be in my top 2 best of all time, up there with LA BBQ. The sausage went down nice and smooth. Not too spicy, good snap from the casing, and slightly coarse ground beef and pork blend. That's the texas trinity,  and I never expected to have it be so good in Arizona. Bravo!

Sides: I tried the beans, potato salad, and grits.  Beans were slightly too thick for me. Very hearty if you like it that way. Potato salad was a tiny bit undercooked.  Just personal preference for me..i like it easier to bite through. Grits were awesome though, really tasty!

Our drinks were good, but expensive. $24.50 for a Bloody Mary...Vegas prices!?!  Whatever.  The bottomless mimosas were just as expected.  The best part was the to-go cups with a fresh mimosa. 

The food.... well, I ordered the Huevos Benedictito, a Spanish version of eggs Benedict.  Great in concept, but not execution.  The English muffin was tough and burnt, the carnitas was hard (how do you get meat hard & dry...too much time under the warming lamp perhaps), but the eggs and sauce were tasty.  At least there was something redeeming about the plate.  And don't even think about getting the hash browns unless you want some undercooked and not seasoned potato strings.  (I think they were potatoes?) They were bland and blended into the plate. My hubby ordered the Beach Bum omelette which looked good and full of veggies. He said it was okay, but he had the same lifeless pile of cardboard shoestring things they called hash browns.

98,758,,"Stayed here for 1 night, 9/2/12 in a Classic room.

How anyone gives this place more than 2 stars beats the hell out me. Needed a last minute place to stay at the end of Labor Day weekend and all I've got to say is: Thank god it was only for one night! Quite possibly the WORST hotel stay EVER.

Arrival/Check In: The parking structure is old , dilapidated, and hard to find, since it is not accessible from Las Vegas Blvd. I didn't drive but I remember having to take some back alley to find the place. Check in was difficult to find (the hotel's theme, apparently). After checking in, we spend literally 20 minutes looking for the elevator up to our room. We given different directions and a lot of pointing in the wrong way. We finally found our elevator to tower 3...located by passing through a narrow corridor by one of the bars. No signs, no nothing. This place is a maze.

Price: Very affordable. Less than $50 a night on most nights (including weekends). No resort fees. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for...

Location: Probably the only reason why this hotel is still in business. Also probably the reason why it wasn't blown sky high by now. Center strip, can't be beat.

Hotel: Falling apart and utterly unpleasant. Low ceiling and pathways make you feel squeezed in. Smoky air. Dark hallways. Carpets are filthy. Elevators buttons don't work and operate ridiculously slow. Noisy from machinery. I don't think the hotel has been remodeled since it opened some 40 years ago and it definitely shows. 

Room: Echoed the rest of the hotel: DIRTY and DARK! The room was tiny. Decor was ancient (Popcorn ceilings and nasty wallpaper!). The lighting was inadequate (just a couple lamps). Beds were springy, old, and uncomfortable. The carpet was so dirty I resorted to wearing sandals around the room. Mid-90's TV. Tiny window with a view of the structure. Old, noisy air conditioner. Outdated, cheaply made bathrooms. Hope you're not a germophobe!

Gambling: Did not gamble here.

Food: Food was overpriced so we did not eat here (ended up grabbing Earl's instead). I heard Hash House a Go Go would be something good to check out though. Maybe next time.

Amenities: No resort fees = no amenities unless you pay for them.

Check out: Don't remember, but it was easy (couldn't wait to get out of here).

Overall: This place is a dump. No other way  to describe it. The only thing this place has going for it is its location and that's good because you won't want to be spending any time at this hotel. You'll notice that anyone who has anything positive to say about this place will mention its location and that ""who spends their time in their room anyways?"" Well, I love going out as much as anyone, but I also need a place to get ready and a place to come back to. The cheap price is not worth putting up with the dirtiness of this hotel IMO. It can't even get the simple things right. Spend a few dollars more and stay at a place like Bally's, Harrah's, Flamingo, Excalibur, or Luxor if you want to be on the strip. There are also plenty of off strip alternatives for around the same price. Until this place (now named The Quad) gets an extensive makeover or gets completely gutted, I would suggest to avoid it like a plague.

Appetizer sampler canoe for 3 - one sample per person of 5 different appetizers.  each item was pretty good, and presentation was beautiful...but I'm not an Iron Chef judge, so I'd rather have a little more quantity for the high price.

Kalbi Spring Rolls - fried spring rolls with a Korean chojang sauce (Korean red pepper paste).  definitely not worth ordering again.

Hibachi Salmon - 6 oz. salmon cooked perfectly w/ literally a little triangle of rice on the side.  

Hawaii Short Ribs - 6 oz. short ribs were melt in your mouth tender, and very flavorful.

Warm Chocolate Souffle - ordered when we sat down to allow for 20 minute preparation.  our favorite part of the meal!

I wouldn't even recommend this place for drinks as service was slow and inattentive at the bar.",2017-02-26 01:04:03
1231,341,,"This is my favorite restaurant in the Las Vegas are.  I have been coming here at least once a month for nearly two years. 

The course starts with a small salad with a delicious peanut based dressing. Next comes the vegetable plate which includes carrots, bamboo shoots, tofu and tofu noodles.  

Next comes the entree.  I almost always order the Jack Beef Shabu Shabu but they offer Sukiyaki and have shrimp, chicken and pork as well.  The Shabu Shabu comes with rice and three dipping sauces (spicy, sesame peanut and ponzu)  The night ends with a perfect scoop of ice cream.

299,1054,,"I've been to Burger Bar a few times now and I am a fan. I couldn't decide between 3 or 4 stars but decided on 3 because there are so many other better options in Vegas. If you are in Mandalay Bay Border Grill is the best restaurant but Burger Bar is not a bad option. 

They have pretty much anything you can think of for your burger. Start out with beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, or many other types of meat. Add whatever cheese and toppings. Then you get to pick your bun from many options (pretzel, wheat, potato, etc). Once you have your burger you have the option for many different types of sides (fries, sweet potato fries, fried zucchini, etc). There are so many options you could get something different every time you come here, even though it is pretty much just burgers. I think they do have a few salads if there are people in your group that would prefer something other than a burger. 

The burger itself was very good. Very juicy and cooked perfectly. Service is a little slow, but not awful. It was slightly overpriced, but comparable for everything in Vegas. 

If I'm in the mood for a burger in Vegas I might return to Burger Bar",2011-08-25 00:39:47

1480,511,,"People had been raving to me about Täkō and I have to say that I was rather disappointed when I finally made it there for dinner. It is quite a small restaurant and reservations for dinner go weeks in advance. You can eat at the bar without a reservation and it turns over relatively quickly, but you might be waiting for a bit. You can make a reservation on their website through Yelp SeatMe. I went with my boyfriend and we had to shout at each other and still couldn't really hear one another. It is incredibly loud in there. It is also so dark you can hardly see the menu or what you're eating. The decor is very confused, with some metal lockers, Christian paraphernalia, and black/red decor that might be found in a dungeon. It was rather dreadful of an atmosphere (the bar looks slightly better since it is a tiny bit better lit and you are sitting right next to anyone you go with, which should make hearing them a little easier). We started off with the house-made guacamole and were not at all impressed with it. I had the mushrooms tacos which were quite tasty, but not enough so to go there again. I had a pretty good mezcal-based drink. The prices were quite high for what we were getting.",2016-03-27 18:50:26

1548,401,,"3.5 stars.

I do dig this gem of a cafe in NoDa, but more for the atmosphere than the baked goods (which I think could use some more oomph). I love the quaint decor, the antique mismatched chairs and spread out feel and the art on the wall. Students studying, a couple playing boardgames, friends catching up - Good vibe. 

Coffee was good, thank goodness, I was dying for java. We sat outside in the atrium, sort of odd that they expand out because it doesn't seem a part of the cafe, but it's so quiet and open, I quite like that they have the space. We had a late lunch and ordered the ham and gruyere tartines. They were tasty, but too small!

Anyway, the main reason I went there was to check out the pastries since I needed dessert for a big family event that's coming up and had read so many rave reviews. The guy at the counter couldn't offer up any free samples (or a smile) but he did walk me through their wonderful looking array of baked goods to tell me what they had which was helpful. I was excited for the tasting and a bit sad that it didn't blow my mind.
I sampled:
Coconut macaroon - meh, a miss for me, I did not dig the sweetener/sugar that they used, I thought they were overpriced, and they were not at all reminiscent of the best macaroons I have ever had, in France. 
Mini berry tart - I wanted to love it, it looked so cute, and it wasn't even too sweet, but it wasn't memorable either.
Chocolate hazelnut tart - recommended by the guy at the counter, I had high hopes for this one, and the chocolate filling, although not really hazelnut-y was decent, but the crust was dry and hard and not ok.
Mini fruit tart - this was the best of the lot, the crust was decent, the custard added moistness. But it didn't make me ooh or ahh either. 

I am disappointed I can't use their baked goods for our event, but they just didn't wow me.

So to sum it up, It's a little out of the way for me, but if I lived closer I would definitely go there often. I was eyeing the chocolate croissant, one of my favorite all time pastries, and I will go for a larger sandwich next time, and maybe sample this salted caramel brownie that is so popular.

Make sure to become a gratzi club member, but have them go over the details with you before you spend any money at the hotel.

Finally got a table on our FOURTH try at stopping by before a game but couldn't get food or drink service at our table, yet people with the visiting teams Jersey on were taken care of. Went to the bar and eventually got two beers, but it took over 20 minutes. Then I had to stand in line to order food, which was more expensive than on nights when the Knights weren't playing. All told, two beers, two hot dogs with an order of fries and an appetizer cost me more than if I went to Bavettes Steakhouse.

That is disappointing, since this is Las Vegas and we have some great food and drink options in town.

My biggest frustration with the T-Mobile Arena is that they now charge for parking.  I understand that stadiums charge people to park, but in Las Vegas parking has always been free.

The next time that I have to go to the T-Mobile Arena I will simply park at another property and walk over - nothing is that far on the Las Vegas strip!

One other frustration was that all of the people on the upper levels were delayed in leaving so that the people on the lower levels could exit first.  T-Mobile needs to get their act together and develop a better crowd control plan.",2016-07-25 18:36:49

The burger was done perfectly - so much so that I wish that I hadn't split it. The fries though were a huge disappointment.

1470,335,,"Moving to Vegas, I needed a new thinking spot and I saw reviews on this park. It seemed so relaxing and I wondered how a park would work especially in Vegas. It made me smile when I came here, because there were many children enjoying the park's amusements for children. They seemed to really enjoy this weird hill thing I saw, but of course, my main focus at the park was to hit the trail.

While searching, there was a nice blend of green where you can have a nice standard picnic at or run a few laps around the track like roads, or move away and see a lot of desert instead. I never really saw parks like these before, so it was quite a bit interesting for me. Upon reaching the hiking trail itself, you'll notice a sign that pretty much tells you that you are advised only to hit the trail during daylight hours. I came during a time where the sun would set soon, because I wanted a nice bit of scenery.

The trail is relatively easy to climb and probably takes 10 minutes at MOST. I didn't have hiking shoes on so I slipped from time to time, but once I got to the top I was pretty amazed. There were picnic areas at the top and an area at the center to sit around and relax.

It made me realize how underdeveloped Vegas is the farther you are from the strip. It was quite interesting to see, but it also gave me a feeling of emptiness. You can see a lot of hills not too far away and the sunset was quite amazing. It was quiet at the top so I felt like I was able to keep a steady mindset while I was here.

When coming back down, I felt like a lot of weight was lifted. Usually downhill hikes can be painful, but because of how short this is, it's pretty light on the legs. (I did leg day at the gym shortly before this.)

I wish I had someone to take, but I can save that for another time.",2013-10-02 06:22:30

1995,777,,"La Banquise aurait apparemment la réputation d'être le meilleur resto de poutine de Montréal. J'ai bien dit ""aurait apparemment"". Nous avons donc eu envie d'aller voir par nous même!  Malheureusement, ce fut encore un cas de ""réputation plus grande que nature"". 
Sur place, nous constatons que l'endroit est minuscule. Les tables et les chaises sont petites, et notre table était sale, il y avait encore de la sauce dessus. J'ai moi-même pris un napkin pour essayer la table! 

Cet endroit est très bien pour connaître les gens; mon voisin de table qui est un parfait étranger était à 10 cm de moi et je pouvais tout suivre de sa conversation avec son ami. 
Après quelques minutes, la serveuse vient prendre la commande; j'opte pour une petite poutine à la sauce poivrée. 
Le service est un peu long, mais les poutines arrivent finalement. 
Les frites ne semblent pas très fraîches et sont un peu mordantes sous la dent, pas très bien cuites. 
Le goût est bien, rien d'extraordinaire; j'ai connu des poutines meilleures ailleurs! 
Ne voulant pas nous arrêter sur une note négative, nous décidons d'essayer les desserts.
Ce ne fût pas vraiment un succès. Le pudding chômeur était sec et un peu granuleux sous la dent, et le gâteau triple chocolat goûtait un peu le congelé, on sentait parfaitement le goût de l'humidité de congélateur à chaque bouchée. 
Alors que nous attendions l'addition, nous remarquons que le sol est bien sale. 
Mais au moins la facture n'était pas très élevée, ca il faut bien leur donner!

405,988,,"Ok so food was decent. I had the carnitas omelette. Carnitas had good flavor and they use an excellent brand of cheese. Hash browns were a bit under-seasoned an limp, so ask for extra crispy if that's your thing, and go with some salt. Pumpkin coffee cake was good, even if the rumors are true that it's from a box. It was gooey and moist and delicious. Coffee is decent too, though not super strong. Service was very quick, once we were actually seated. (see below)

Major downside...we came on a Saturday morning when there was obviously a crowd waiting, which was fine. We were told the wait was about 30 minutes, which was fine. We went outside because it was a bit crowded inside. After about 15-20 minutes, we got a little chilly and came inside. We were told there were some benches around the corner from the hostess table, so we went and sat down. Another 30 minutes later, I decided to check I see how far we were on the list, since we had been there for close to an hour at that point. The hostess showed me her wait list, which revealed that our name had been crossed off long ago and that at least half a dozen people had been seater after we should have been. When I pointed to my name, the hostess said ""Oh, well I called your name."" All I could say was that we had been right outside and then inside on the benches around the corner. She did seat us pretty much immediately at that point, but did t seem the slightest bit apologetic that we had been skipped. 

Overall, good experience. Just maybe don't go during peak hours to make sure you don't slip through the wait list cracks.",2017-12-16 20:55:15
1685,727,,"Quick summary:

- smoke everywhere
- ""Hotel"" aspect is mediocre.
- fountains, shows, pastry shops are nice.
- would not return for the price, better options elsewhere.



Details:


- A non smoking room means 'maybe non smoking' because people disregard the smoking rules all the time.

- Even a non smoking room gets you covered with smoke every time you leave or enter your room, because you have to walk through the casino.    Book the Spa tower to avoid.

- The restaurants, though 'no smoking', will have cigarette smoke if it's near the casino.  Yellowtail for sure has cigarette smoke everywhere, Le Cirque can also have cigarette smoke (depending on if they close the door).  Sensi is far from the smoke, but we saw somebody smoking in the restaurant with no enforcement of the law.    Michael Mina's is pretty smoke-free.  

- Overall, smoke is better than Harrah's and Caesar's, but worse than the Venetian.

- cleaning staff is top notch, our room was sparkling clean every day.

- Concierge staff is not as top notch - we asked for a lingerie store.  There's like 4 in the area, but they had to think hard to come up with one.  Other similar examples.

- Pool closed early (4P?) all the time.  They don't want you at the pool, they want you gambling.

- asked for tailor service, they didn't have it.  Not a big deal, but it's not the Mandarin Oriental or anything.

- Workout room is $25 a day 

- No wireless but they do have wired for $15 a day.  But they charge $15 if you need an ethernet cable.  Bring your own.

- if you touch the snacks, you get charged because they are set to charge on weight change.  Seriously.


- JP Maury Pastry shop is one of the best (if not the best) in Vegas.

- Fountains are the best free show on the strip.

We finished off with the chocolate sata andagi. The donuts were fluffy and the flavours of the ice cream, chocolate ganache and red fruit coulis was perfect.

Surprised at how large the airport is or seems to be. There are plenty of long walk ways to the gates or a ride on the people movers if feeling too lazy to foot it. Or a ride on the pallett jacks with benches seems to be a popular mode of transport.

Big plus is the free wi-fi. Other people seem to not have much luck with a connection, but mine seems just fine.

Not a ton of food options at all. CPK to go, Pizza Hut, Cinnabon. Typical mall food.

Where else can you find a circular fireplace? Let's just say this is a stationary limo where the choices of specialty cocktails are abundant.

As awesome as the ambience is, let's get down (no pun intended) to the real reason this place is a must in spending time in Vegas. The food is great. Wide selection, huge portions (A-muuuur-ri-cuh), and ridiculous affordable prices.

Be aware that the buns are ciabatta buns - if you're an avid fan of brioche buns. I've tried the potato fries once and they are great!

Now, the atmosphere of the restaurant. A very ""plateau"" vibe with good service. Note that the restaurant is very small, but size does not matter here. The customers usually go for a quick meal, but it's always better to take-out.

The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.

The crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!

The Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!

My friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!",2017-03-15 02:28:50

54,1035,,"It looks like it's all been said before, so I'll keep this short (as much as I can manage) and sweet.  

Impressive digs: the sculptural treehouse dining room is a gem.  The bar is impressive (a two story shelf of bottles).  

The service is absolutely top notch: when we arrived for our 8:30 pm reservations, the hosts apologized but there was going to be a twenty minute delay.  We weren't bothered at all by the wait, but we were still given glasses of complimentary champagne--and we were treated to the restaurant's signature Warm Butter Cake for dessert.  I have absolutely no complaints about the delay in getting seated.  Mastro's handled a difficult situation appropriately, and in my opinion, went above and beyond for myself and the other guests that were also seated late.

My boyfriend and I went all out for dinner and ordered the seared ahi appetizer as well as the Hamachi with Fried Onions.  Please, oh please make sure you get this.  I've never seen anything like it before.  The perfectly fried onions melt on your tongue like butter, and the hamachi was perfect.  What an amazing combination.

We ordered the Bone-In 12 Oz Filet and the 22 Oz Rack of Lamb with a side of Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese and Roasted Brussels Sprouts. 

The proteins were cooked perfectly and were absolutely delicious, but the stand out dish on the table was the flippin' amazing Mac & Cheese.  We talked about it at the restaurant, as we were leaving the restaurant, while we were next door at the Aria casino, on our flight home, and ever since we've been back home.  They are out of this world.  We were so sad that we weren't able to take home the leftovers.

Dessert: what hasn't been said about the Warm Butter Cake already?  Just get it already.

It's a whole fish.

Even though our server was very friendly, I was also very disappointed with him. It was rare that he came by to check on us and he had also forgotten to give us the corn bread. When he wasn't there to check on us, we resorted to asking a different waitress that walked by for boxes and the check. However, she didn't bother, probably because we weren't her table. Rudeness...

The things that stood out on the menu were some Filipino dishes that you're not used to seeing at any restaurant that serves sushi.  According to the waiter, the head chef is a Filipino guy.  The waiter did a very good job selling the stuff to us, but as a Filipino, I certainly knew better than to pay $18 for six pieces of lumpia, or $20 for some pancit.  I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army.  Most of what we ordered was less than memorable and what really stood out were the steaks.  The filet came out rare and the ribeye came medium rare.  Both were amazing!  I'd go back and order just those.

It's worth it. We barely spent any time in our hotel room (and if you're staying at Imperial Palace, you'll do ANYTHING to avoid spending time there).

91,69,,"This place is over the top! The food is great and the portions...when the hell did every restaurant in Vegas begin serving only sumo wrestlers. My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. 

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either. She gave me a look like, do you still want in or not, I have other people to be rude to.",2014-11-30 03:22:06

I always pick up a couple things to eat on the drive back too, usually the mochiko chicken and the loco moco.  There is nowhere in the OC (or even LA) that makes loco moco nearly as good.  The Loft and L&L, in particular, should hang their heads in shame.  The gravy is dark and rich and flavorful and portion-size is huge.

Our personal experience has been that the best time is generally between 6PM and 8PM. To grab fresh stuff off the belt that is. 

As mentioned by other reviewers, they'll make rolls fresh for you. The other reviews are all pretty much on the money. It's definitely a fun place to go with friends and affordable.

I decided on the Si Jiu Beef Noodles. It had marinated beef, pan fried noodles, and veggies. The waiter said it was normally very spicy so I decided to order it mild since I sweat like crazy with spicy food. Unfortunately it was so mild that I didn't taste any of the spiciness at all. What I did taste was pain from the fresh pan fried noodle center. This was a dish to be eaten slowly! I ended up burning my mouth a little but I needed to get back in to the action.

1682,1105,,"I really want to give this place a higher score, but I'm torn because while I have been here a great many times, and often bring visiting friends and family, I was pretty peeved at the service last Friday night 6-12-2015. 

I genuinely got the feeling that the management had taken the night off, and the inmates were running the asylum because despite the fact that the place was somewhat empty by the time we got there, late in the evening, the front-of-house staff was out-to-lunch so to speak.

The place was really noisy despite being half empty. The water they brought was warm as were the three glasses they brought. We also had to push pushes to the adjoining empty table because the staff wasn't removing them.

One thing they don't put on the menu is that if you opt to order a Coca-Cola vs. say some beer, etc., the soda comes in a can (which had a weird smell to it), and at $2 for a can and a warm glass, it's a pretty extreme 10x markup.

Food-wise, the pizza to get remains the tricolore.

We tried the arancini as an appetizer, and it lacked seasoning. The server brought a small tin of marina, which wasn't enough for the 4 balls, and when we asked for more, they failed to bring more. In the end, we didn't finish the appetizer because the balls got cold.

My father got the bolognese, which I didn't try, though he said mine had more flavor. 
I'd really like to try the other pasta dish sometime, as it looks quite good.

It would seem this restaurant has seen better days, but I'm not sure. If they make some small changes in the kitchen and retrain the wait staff, it might be worth visiting again.",2015-06-20 23:23:02

1981,790,,"I was in Vegas for a few days for some R&R with my wife.  We stayed at the Strip but wanted to get away to eat everyday.  I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.  Spot on!  It is exactly what the reviews say: a cute hole-in-the-wall place on a strip mall just a mile or so away from the strip.

I wasn't sure what to order, I like to look at other people's plates when I arrive at a restaurant and kept asking the server to tell me what they were. I'm a huge fan of biscuits and gravy so that's my go-to breakfast when in doubt. The French Toast on the table next to us looked delicious and I was leaning that direction.  Then, I saw it, the Country Fried Steak... holy schmoly, mother of all cholesterol... I couldn't take my eyes off it, it was staring at me from the table next door... and if I kept really quiet I could hear it calling my name.  So I canceled the French Toast and went with the Country Fried Steak.  The wait seemed like an eternity but my wife assures me it was less than 10 minutes; and then, it arrived.

A huge breaded, fried piece of meat, laying next to a plateful of hash browns, three eggs on top of the potatoes, and gravy all over the steak.  I didn't know whether to smile or cry, I was so happy.  So after taking a picture I began the careful operation of breaking the egg yolks so they could infiltrate the hash browns.  This must be done carefully so that there is enough egg yolk to go around.  Trust me, with three eggs, there was plenty of egg yolk to turn the carefully-cooked hash browns into a golden, delicious pile of oh-my-gosh!  Each bite was celestial and I found myself quietly moaning inside my mouth as I enjoyed this wonderful breakfast.

I ordered a biscuit and gravy on the side, just because it's not breakfast without biscuits and gravy.  The biscuit is not really a biscuit but a roll under disguise.  My recommendation, skip it.  My wife had the big breakfast with eggs, meats, biscuit and pancakes; she could only finish about half of it.  She loved it also.

The servers were very friendly, the owner is a hoot.  He has a really groovy, deep, radio voice that fits his former wrestler frame just right.  The place can fill up fast, when we arrived there was no wait (10:30 am) but it quickly filled up and we saw people waiting for a good 15-20 minutes for a table so be prepared for either scenario.",2014-08-20 14:22:25
1005,88,,"When in Vegas you do things that you do not say and the things your friends shall not repeat!  

So lets say you are at a convention and having drinks when one of the guys tells you he has a cabana reserved at a nightclub called Surrender?  You look around and notice you are 10 guys, but you shrug your shoulders and hop in a limo to the Encore Hotel.

You then get there and find Bobby.  You tell Bobby that you reserved a cabana , give him a credit card and get your ID out to prove that you are twice the age limit which means you will be twice as fun.  The guy looks at you but does not think it is funny!  But as you whiz past the club hopefuls, you take note of everyone in the harsh lighting as you don't want to regret things later. As you enter the club they brand you with the ""over 40"" stamp and walk past the inside club which is dark and out into the shallow pool area which in the dream that I had is littered with young sirens in short dresses on lily pad like tables. It is a stadium-like atmosphere with tables and loungers around the pool and 2 floors of cabanas along the rim. For your money you will be happy to be outside with the big money players who are hoping to get played or to play you.  Fortunately this is only a dream and doesn't happen in real life. 

You get escorted to your cabana and your exotic cabana beauty named Shelley who is made up of what seems like 10 different ethnic backgrounds squeezed into a size zero dress  and 5 inch heels starts pouring drinks.  Remember that you are with 10 guys and the testosterone levels are raging.  Fortunately for Shelley there are scantily clad women lounging all around the cabana waiting for you to invite them over to drink your booze.  You watch as your friends somehow convince them to enter your den of wolves and look foolish.  Remember,  you took mental photos outside.  

Suddenly, like the movies, everything turns to slo-mo as cool people enter the cabana next door and start displaying the cool dance moves you once had before you had that accident where you damaged both your knees trying to ascend Everest for the 100th time.  The women look amazing and one of the guys invites you over and introduces himself.  He knows you are a baller as you shelled out dough to attract cabana babes.  He looks over your 10 homies and asks where the girls are.  You lie and tell him you are celebrating ""Ethan's Freedom and Divorce"".  You find out your new friend is from another club and he and ""his girls"" are VIP hosts and hostesses. And now the females come and introduce themselves and tell you they'd like to see you at their club!  They take some selfies with you and now you see your buddies gazing over.  The myth has now begun and you are a Vegas God for future stories. Lol!

The rest of the night is a blur.  You wake in the morning alone with no chickens or tigers in your room and a full set of teeth. You do have a stamp on your hand and a mouth full of cotton balls though.  Yep, it didn't happen like that.  Those pictures on your phone are fake.

I have brought friends here, and they too have enjoyed the experience.  Recently, my fiancee and I order samosas to go... and these were wonderful.  If you have not had Indian food before, I strongly recommend coming in and trying the buffet so as to sample some of the wonderful dishes.  However, if you are familiar with Indian food; this place will not disappoint and there is the option of ordering from a menu or the buffet for lunch.

Cons: Obnoxious room service. I had the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door and still got my door banged down at 8am. My friend staying at the same hotel on the same night experienced the same thing-in fact, housekeeping walked in on her while she was taking a bath. Another issue I had was with using my room key in the elevators-half the time, they didn't work.

The crispy ""beef"" was very crispy and had a good flavor, but it didn't taste like meat to me, which is a plus. However, the roti with curry sauce was the highlight of our meal and tasted delicious. 

We had a groupon, which we weren't allowed to use with the lunch special and we had forgotten the details of the groupon because we have so many. The waitress was able to accommodate us by switching  everything from lunch special to full prices. If we had known this, we might have ordered other things.

856,890,,"Somehow or another, I had never been to this tourist attraction at the Paris, but, having a coupon from a friend who had recently and previously been to Vegas, we were able to get one ticket  at full price in exchange for an additional one for free. This depends on the time of day you go, but if you choose night, then you're looking at a total of $23 for two originally priced tickets of  about $12. The reason the math still looks like its for two is because there is a ~$2.50 surcharge per ticket, which is  annoying. Its absolutely essential you get this deal, and if not, just wait until its available to scale this monument.
Speaking of scale, it's 1/2 scale of the original Parisian World Fair of 1889 entrance, making it around 500 feet high instead of the 1,050 feet of the original, but its still startling for its views at night. After you pay, you get your picture taken by a photographer upon a walkway that promenades across the Paris casino. You'll notice that the foundations of this tower are actually indoors and when you go up, you're outdoors with phenomenal vistas of the Bellagio (where you can watch the fountain shows if you're able to sit on some space circumventing the see-through safety fence). The Cosmo, Paris and even further hotels like the Aria and NYNY are easily seen at night.

The day we went it was raining a little, so they didn't give us very much time at some of the stops, and I felt kind of rushed because of this. I understand they basically never get rain, but it was only a little drizzle, and we were on an adventurous tour. Otherwise, the tour guides are great.

The pulled corned beef had a great sear on it with a nice malliard browning along with some caramelized onions, red skin potatoes, and two eggs over easy and I was in corned beef nirvana.  The owners really spent some time perfecting this simple yet amazing dish.

The place is quaint with a creative decor and spinning umbrellas line the ceiling, a friendly homey staff and lavazza coffee, fresh pressed orange juice made fresh daily make it a breakfast spot not to miss!

998,413,,"NOTE TO YELPERS: 3 Stars doesn't mean that something is bad. People give out praise FAR TO EASILY and are overly harsh ALL THE TIME on here, so let's all make  more of an effort to be honest with our reviews.

First time I've been to one of the much talked about Las Vegas buffet's! After hearing that a co-worker of my wife's raved about it and a friend of ours that actually lives in Vegas say that it's definitely one of the best, I was pretty excited about eating here. We decided to drive down instead of walking or taking a cab. Trust me when I say, don't take a cab, just drive if you really wanna get there in a hurry. The Self Parking at the Cosmo is an absolute piece of cake. Well, enough about The Cosmo and more about Wicked Spoon!

Perhaps I was ill informed about cost, because I went in thinking it was gonna be around $50 for two people. Oh no, it was $75! Granted this was New Years Eve and everything in Vegas seems much more expensive this time of year, but at this price I was seriously hoping that I was going to be blown away. 

We got in line and it moved fairly quickly, this is big spot and either due to the time of day or the fact that they have so many tables it just seemed to be a ten minute wait in line (if it was even that long). We were brought to our table and we both ordered orange juice. I would've liked a mimosa, but I didn't realize it was extra to get alcohol. Granted, that is entirely my mistake, but it would've been nice if they said something before we went in. 

The most important part is, of course, the food. It is without a doubt the best buffet I've ever been to! The stand outs had to have been the smoked salmon, the green beans, the fried chicken and the ramen noodles. Oh and the duck confit ravioli would've absolutely been killer, but I didn't like the cinnamon on it, just a little too sweet. The portions are just right, as you're able to sample a bunch of different foods without over doing it on the actual intake side of things. 

Would I go back? Probably not. Not that it isn't good by any means, it is. It's an above average breakfast and a great buffet. I just know that there is better food in Vegas and that I've had better breakfasts plenty of times in my life.",2012-12-31 22:11:41
580,849,,"Upon checking at THEhotel we were aggressively sold an ""upgrade"" to a 2 bedroom suite at the Mandalay with the promise that the room would be ""high up"" in the hotel. The room turned out to be on the 6th floor, right over a roof full of air conditioners, almost directly above the tram stop, and just a couple of dozen feet from the busy ramp to the lobby. When we complained the hotel staff stated that there was nothing they could do because the hotel was full. The end.

The suite it self was generally VERY dingy, dusty and shabby. The furniture was severely nicked, scratched, and gouged, some with the veneer splitting from age. There were big chunks of wood trim around the bathroom sink broken away, exposing the particle board underneath, and the trim was splitting from age and water damage. The trim around the bedroom door was falling off, not just loose, falling off, and a bedroom door handle came off in the hand of one of our party. Curtains were ripped, lamp shades were broken, there were dirty circles around door handles, and a big greasy circle around the peephole. We were somewhat encouraged that our windows still provided a partial view of the strip, but the windows were filthy.

Our hypothesis is that this was a room that could never be sold for full price, so they ""upgrade"" guests and still have a very desirable room to sell to somebody else. It sounds like it should be illegal to me. After being rebuffed in a couple of attempts to complain one of our party suggested that we might get a comp if we keep complaining. My response was ""with what, another stay at the Mandalay?"" Big laugh, point taken. My position on the Mandalay at this point is: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. It was a terrible experience, but at least I have the comfort of knowing that I can prevent it from ever happening again by not going back.",2013-09-24 17:19:25

Driving up, I couldn't tell whether it was open or not.  It does seem a bit like a truck stop/diner, but have no fear and enter through the doors.

354,1178,,"Tao is one of the most beautiful and spacious clubs I have ever been in. Seriously, it is like the best feast for your eyes. In every way this could be a place out of a movie. The cool and trendy Asian fusion inspired place where a major scene occurs. 

But the thing is, you can't enjoy it at all. The line outside is insane, there must have been 1000 people in line when we got there at 11:30pm. Then we managed to cut the line due to the ""finesse"" of some guys we met in the casino. As soon as you get in, you are literally shoulder to shoulder with someone. I guess I'm lucky to be decently tall for an Asian girl, otherwise I might have suffocated in shoulders. Not only that, they totally skimp on the air cond. I mean seriously, Vegas is HOT, the only reason to go clubbing in Vegas, vs the normal home town is that you expect the eye candy to be better and to finally by graced by the presence of being cooled from the heat. But it was cooler outside the club in the middle of summer that is how hot it was. It was so dark and crowded I couldn't make out any candy. Then the dance floor was packed, literally the only thing one could try to do to dance is jump up and down. 

Lame. The one thing was that the drinks were ok, but drinks can pretty much be ok anywhere you go. I would totally pass on Tao, if it weren't so pretty inside and the music wasn't decent, which it was, I would have given it one star.",2008-08-19 08:43:50
1763,1016,,"It's been four days and I am still in a recovery process from eating here. 

I looked up the place during my stay at the Luxor hotel in Las Vegas. This was one of the restaurants that called my attention for a nice New Year's Eve diner. I called up to make a reservation for my family. Everything was fine when we arrived, the hostess were friendly and the place was elegant, yet a bit casual - it was perfect for what I was looking for. 

It was New Year's Eve so they seemed busy, but I particularly found rude or our server kept shaking his leg as if he was impatient to take our order. There were plenty of servers but somehow he was in a rush to take our order... 

My biggest complain with this place was the fact that I got sick from eating here. I don't recall the name of the dish, but it included pasta with meat sauce. Simple, cheap food to make, yet the price was on the mid 20's. The flavor was bland, but I ate it anyway. Worst mistake ever- I spent the first day of the year with diarrhea & fever. As for my family, they didn't get sick since they got different dishes but their food was not flavorful. 

We didn't get any bread at our table until I requested it and it arrived later after our food had arrived and we were  halfway done. 

We asked for more bread since they had given us four small slices for five people -- when the server brought us he bread he said ""this is all I have,"" without apologizing. 

No one ever came to check on our table even though there were plenty of servers standing around in the corner talking to each other... 

Overall, it was an awful experience - there are plenty of great restaurants on the strip & this one is one to avoid. 

This place did not meet the standards for the high prices they charge. The extra start is for the restaurant itself looking nice & the hostess.",2018-01-04 20:58:18

2) Bone-in Filet (one of the best steaks I have had)
3) Warm Butter Cake (it doesn't matter how full you are, just order it - it's life changing) 

Of course, the bread bowl they set on the table is amazing (especially the pretzel bread), but you will regret filling up on too much bread because the rest of the meal is even better.

952,979,,"First things first: if plants are not your thing, and I mean ANY plants, don't bother coming here; you will be bored out of your skull! If plants ARE your thing, then plan to spend a good portion of your day here and bring sunscreen, a big hat or an umbrella, or all three! 

As a Wisconsin gal, I had recently gotten into desert flora (can you say addicted, boys and girls?) and knew that this was a must see on one of my many trips to see the folks. 

For the most part, I knew what to expect. I had, by the time of this trip, been no stranger to book after book on desert plants......not just cacti, but other succulents and wildflowers as well. What I didn't expect was the size of this place and the beautiful groupings of the plants, not to mention the size of the groupings and even some of the plants themselves! You may think that you know what an agave looks like and how big it can get, but until you see a plant with a 10 foot diameter and 20 foot flower stalk growing out of it's middle, you have no idea! Or the 20 foot tall saguaro with 10 arms growing out of it, each arm approximately 10 inches in diameter? Yeah, those are things you have to see to believe!

Other than birds and a few squirrels, there wasn't much wildlife to be seen.

Just before leaving, we went into the gift shop where they sell the usual souvenirs: magnets, books, mugs, etc. Because this was a GARDEN, they also sold gardening stuff: gloves, a few small hand tools, pots....even seeds and plants. The prices on the plants was actually quite reasonable, but of the ones I wanted, they didn't have any small enough for me to stash in my luggage....they were all 10 inch specimens or larger. Everything else was, as expected, overpriced.

A nice little surprise was the Chihuly glass sculptures at the entrance to the garden, and then throughout, the various (not Chihuly) sculptures situated in the landscapes.

This is one of those places that you want to return to, but you need some time away so it doesn't bore you when you visit again. For me, it's been almost 10 years.....looks like I'm due another visit!

865,740,,"We went straight to the buffet right after our flight landed in Vegas to fill our empty stomachs. We expected the wait to be at least an hour long but surprisingly we were seated right away for a table of 2 at 5:30pm on a Friday. We heard lots of great things about this buffet and as it's a little pricier than most other hotel buffets ($57.99 + tax per person for a weekday dinner compared to something like MGM's buffet for $29.99) we expected the best selection and quality. They have a large selection of seafood such as hot and cold offerings of crab legs already cut for you so you don't need to spend time cracking them open, crawfish, and oysters. This is the only place I've been to where the crab legs have been conveniently cut open and with their drawn butter it definitely helps with the consumption of large amounts of crab. We weren't a big fan of the oysters as they didn't tend to be that meaty and it was easy to get pieces of shell when slurping them. They have a large meat station that has a variety of meats like prime rib, beef brisket, and spicy pork sausage. The prime rib can come dripping with blood depending on the cut they give you and the spicy pork sausage was mind-blowingly spicy so beware. They had a spinning taco stand where you have someone making fresh tacos with three different types of meat. The tacos weren't anything to write home about and it consisted of either pork, chicken or beef filling and two round small layered soft taco shells heated on the spinning grill. The sushi offering wasn't the best with just 2-3 types of rolls and tuna nigiri. They also had a soup stand where you could get pho noodle soup or ramen dish as well as dim sum type foods such as the dumplings, again nothing too special here as far as quality if you compare it to a stand alone pho or ramen shop. Easily the highlight of the buffet for us was the dessert island. They were fully stocked with 4 different flavors of macarons, chocolate covered strawberries, gelatos, cake pops, many different fudge flavors, colorful cupcakes and small cakes and cookies and even a thai ice tea with boba. The service wasn't amazing as our plates were cleared after the first time but we didn't see the server again after that. Our table slowly filled up with empty used plates. Overall the selection is great and the ambiance is nice but we're not sure we would choose it again over a different buffet especially one that's half the price.",2016-09-06 01:21:59

1116,268,,"We visited this restaurant a few times now. Our first time was with friends who told us about it as they live nearby (we live in Gilbert). We had a couple bottles of wine and all had entrees. They have several 'homemade' pastas daily in addition to the regular pasta meals. My husband had the homemade Fusilli which has red sauce, peppers, mushrooms and ground up Italian sausage. The noodles are smooth and not spiral like typical fusilli but man it was so good you don't care! It was delicious!! I had the pasta in a vodka sauce with shrimp. The shrimp were HUGE and perfectly cooked. The pasta was al dente and the sauce was rich and tasty. They serve a wonderfully soft italian bread with butter and parm w/seasonings over the top which is really good!! We really liked the place so returned to try the pizza. The wood fired oven really makes a great pie! It is definitely in the top pizzas here in the Valley which says a lot from an east coast gal! Their brushetta, which is like a pizza without sauce or cheese just the brushetta toppings, on a small pizza dough crust is really good as well. Lots of fresh garlic which we just LOVE! My husband continually gets the fusilli each time we go as he just loves it...that's his staple dish. I like to try new things. I tried the shrimp scampi the last time I was there and it was SO good..the sauce is different than I've had before...so good you wanted to just eat more bread dipped in the sauce until it was gone. Our friends had the seafood (mussels, shrimp etc) dish and said it was very good and also the pesto alfredo which I tried and have to say it was as amazing! They are supposed to be introducing a larger bar menu in October (other than beer and wine which they had previously) with some specialty drinks so I'll be looking forward to another visit soon to try one out!!

126,690,,"I wanted to like this place more, but it was solidly average.  The menu was good with decent variety of savory and sweet waffle choices among other breakfast items.  They had gluten free waffles, which was nice due to a family member having a gluten sensitivity, and I had the chicken and waffles.  Like other reviews stated, it was decent, but for $40 for 2 adults and 2 kids (who split a breakfast), I wanted to be wow'd.  

I always want to start with the good, but I think I already mentioned all the good.  Good menu with decent food.  They did have some decent syrup choices outside maple.  We tried the vanilla and bourbon syrup.  This isn't vanilla flavored maple syrup, it is vanilla syrup that pours clear.  The bourbon on the chicken and waffles was very good.

Now on to what could make it better, with some of problems not being able to be changed.  I think the biggest problem was the noise.  It is a no frills décor restaurant with two walkways with tables on both sides, but the room just echoed terribly.  I could barely hear anything my family was saying across the table.

Our server was ok, but it was just slow.  We did go on a packed Saturday, so it is understandable, but I need a bigger coffee cup than the Dixie cup sized cup of coffee they gave me which was gone is 0.2 seconds.  It would be nice if they had runners in addition to the servers.  For a breakfast place, your coffee cup should never be empty.  In addition, our food was not very hot due to the fact that I stared at it sitting in the window for several minutes.  It really wasn't our waitresses fault since she was taking orders at the time.  (of course, it was the people who had a million questions, seriously people, it is a waffle place with good descriptions on the menu).  By the time she took their order than got our food, it was not that hot.  It would have been nice to have someone running food out and filling coffee cups.

Rest everything is what you would expect out of a food chain, same menu, same food, same this, same that :) .. though I was not very happy with the soft taco. Nope not very happy. It was just alright, everything in there right from chicken to cheese demanded an increase in quantity for sure.

1497,150,,"Kinda like the Exploratorium in San Francisco but for the 21st century.  The Miniature Railroad  was the highlight at least for me.  A million kids running around .

1036,244,,"In all honesty, with the plethora of great places to eat inside the MGM, this was literally our last resort: The Mayweather match was happening that night and all the other sit down restaurants were totally booked up. Unless it's my only option again, I doubt I'll be back.

But let me be clear: Everything about the place except for the food was great . It's a beautiful restaurant with a lovely ambiance. We sat near the back and the server was EXCEPTIONAL, being very attentive to our table and helpful with the ordering process. Even the gentleman refilling my water was careful to make sure my cup never went empty and I drink a looooot of water. But the food. Meh. ""Tapas"" portions but not really. The shrimp in the shrimp risotto was too salty to even consume. The filet was pretty decent but ""pretty decent"" in Vegas isn't really saying much...

I do have to commend them, however, for having a seperate menu for those with food  restrictions (vegan, vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free and shellfish/seafood free) which you can find here: https://www.mgmgrand.com/pdf/crush_vegan_menu.pdf",2014-05-08 00:35:07

1668,689,,"When I visit Pittsburgh I always come here on the first night of my arrival.  It has the most amazing selection of Belgian (as well as non-Belgian) beers outside of Brugges (not the Pittsburgh restaurant, but the city).

The place is usually bustling, but I've seen it on busy nights and quiet nights, always on a Friday or Saturday.  It's best to go late for the deals.  After 10pm they serve all of their bar appetizer dishes at 1/2 off.  These dishes are absolutely delicious.  I've had just about all of them and I have to stop myself each time from totally pigging out.  My recommendation is to get the Mediterranean Nachos - chewy yet slightly crunchy pita chips with Greek-style tomatoes, cheese, olives, etc.  You also can't miss with the boneless Buffalo (chicken) bites.  Speaking of buffalo...their buffalo burger as part of the regular menu is also very tasty.  *Drools*

But seriously, food is probably not what they are known for, and I don't think I would even come to this place just for the food.  People come here for the beer.  It's a samplers paradise with decent prices but truly a great range of selection that warrants a beer menu several pages long with prices ranging from $2.50 to $50+ per glass/bottle.

The first thing I order is a Leffe Brun - my favorite beer.  It's like dessert to me.  After that I pick almost randomly - closing my eyes and throwing my finger down on a delicious trappist ale.  You can also get a sampler selection, which I've done, and this is probably the best way to get introduced to new flavors and varieties of beer.  I'm not a heavy drinker but it's like being a kid in a candy store here.  It's difficult to not get uber-buzzed or drunk.  Seriously.

This place is a must if you're ever in the City of Bridges.

Way to vegas from junction plane was 1.5hrs late then leaving vegas to grand junction we were told we had to board an hour early. Then we didn't leave until scheduled time. Sat on the tarmack for 40 min because the proper paperwork to take off was not done with the airport. Of course the A/C didnt work. Ready for take off and now the hydraulic light issue causes us to change planes.   Not bad enough? Flight attendants were so  rude on both flights.

1260,320,,"Cool stuff.

I came here based on reviews while wandering downtown after getting out of business trip obligations early, and it was a perfect place for a solo dinner with a couple beers.

The interior is cool, a modern take on a classic bistro look with the same posters and warm ambiance but high ceilings, couch seating at some tables, and cool lighting. Of note: a sweet chef's counter you can sit at in the back that overlooks the kitchen.

Great selection of local brews and cool upscale food, all with suggested beer pairings, or beer in the food! I had a ""devil's puttanesca"" mussel bowl - think mussels made with pasta puttanesca ingredients with a pale ale instead of a white wine. Seriously good mussels, and seriously great broth with extra bread to soak it up delivered upon request. Sweet.

So definitely good for solo dining, and I could certainly see myself here with a smallish group also. Solid work, Beer Bistro.",2009-08-10 03:42:24

How the heck do I get here on the elevator like some of the others? Urgh. If i could sprout wings, I definitely would. This place is like a destination location.

Every single time I have come here I am introduced to a new set of stairs. As much as I want to OOoo and Ahhh about how wondrous this place is, I'll have to say it's okay. On the initial visit, I lost the bachelorette party I came with and had to do the whole ""I'm next to a pool. You are too? I don't see you! Oh you're by the OTHER pool"" bit.  Suffice to say, it took awhile to reunite. This place is huge. 

The last time I was here was this past St. Patrick's Day when Kaskade performed. Amen to getting tickets in advance!! BF, friends, and myself all walked in without a hitch. The dance floor filled up rather quickly. People claiming to be Kaskade's brother's friends' barber from another mother fist pumped and jumped on my toes. Yeah, no thanks. We got in at 9pm and waited until Kaskade's set four hours later. The first resident DJ was ok. The dj after him was pretty bad. Come 1am, the entire vibe inside the room changed and it was completely enthralling. The moment Kaskade stepped onto the stage it was party time.  

People were fist pumping/ shoving/ throwing drinks on one another. Little people were getting trampled. It was chaos. 

It wasn't until almost 3am when security started getting involved with moving the crowd along the floor. Thank God and thank you Kaskade for making that night one of the best experiences I've had in Vegas.",2012-03-30 04:11:09

1028,1174,,"I took a client to CraftSteak on my last visit to Las Vegas to celebrate a successful negotiation and overall business trip.  I had never eaten in one of Tom Colicchio's establishments but had wanted to for some time.  My first trip was an absolute home run.

Seated at the bar because we hadn't made a rezzie, which was fine with both of us, the bartender, JT was a tip top pro.  Courteous, attentive without being pushy, and knowledgeable.  In addition to the suggestions he made for us, I listened to him him with a couple other patrons regarding scotch, wine, and food.  Normally you'll hear sort of rote suggestions across the board, but he listened to what they were looking for and made specific comments and recommendations.  I suggest you seek him out should you be at the bar.

Normally I don't do a blow by blow of what I ordered, but this meal was exceptional...

I had the Frisee Salad,  NY Strip (not the kobe), with sides of Mashed Potatoes, and White Corn.   A client  had warned me that the sides were ridiculously good and they did not disappoint.  The Frisee was served warm with house-cured bacon with soft, creamy, and very pungent orbs of Blue Cheese interspersed.  JT was not sure what kind of Blue Cheese it was (he offered to find out), but I commented that you didn't get cheated on the portion, which made him smile.  I couldn't stop eating it.  The NY Strip is prepared bone-on, and then the bone is removed from the strip but served should you decide to attack it. (Yeah, I did).  It was cooked exactly as I'd asked.  I used to be a pure medium-rare guy but as I've begun to climb in years have moved to med-rare plus.  The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious and the sweet white corn succotash the perfect foil.

I was such a hog that I even had the Monkey Bread with Caramel-Cinnamon Ice Cream and a Cappuccino for dessert. 

Not a place to go on the cheap or on a diet.  Be prepared...and enjoy.  If you're in the mood for a steak, gastronomically, it's the bomb.  JT called it a ""death-row"" meal.  (As in if you were on death row and had a last meal)  I'd have to concur.  Fortunately, I get to go back.",2009-10-14 23:56:22

My son got a chocolate tarte and it was so rich he couldn't finish the small portion. The staff are very kind and even let my daughter use their restroom although it was not for customers.

What does this even mean? Well as a burger restaurant it falls flat on its face. To meat tasted dry and bland. Lots of bread, and for the cost really leaves you craving more. 

As a dessert joint with their hard shakes, it's a real winner. The milk shakes are large and offer unique toppings. Even though they are 15.00 you feel like it's worth it. Would I ever go back? Only for a quick unique dessert. Never will I eat dinner here though.",2017-08-10 04:41:49

As a table of four, we started off with the Guy-Talian Fondue Dippers and Fireball Whiskey Wings. The cheese that came with the dippers was phenomenal, and we saved the leftovers for our fries later on during our mean! The wings were amazing but were definitely spicy. Didn't taste like cinnamon though, which I was happy about! We skipped the Greens, because lets get real, this isn't a place for healthy eating! We had the Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger, which was also a delicious option. We shared the brisket sandwich, which I didn't try, but my boyfriend said it was amazing but had a bit too much sauce. 

To top off our extremely greasy meal, we got the Triple Doublemint Pie. YUM! I was kind of bummed there was only one oreo on there and two or three junior mints, but it was still delicious. Definitely enough ice cream to share with 6 people!

For 23 dollars a person, 1 person gets to pick two selection. For the first round, my fiance and I got 4 custom rolls, Wet Dreams, Superman, One Night Stand & Strip Tease. Yes the names are funny but they are hella good.

After the first round, we ordered some entree items with nigris.  We got full after that and ordered half rolls (AWESOME)

848,621,,"This review is a long time coming from me.  Only having lived in the Gilbert area for about 9 years, I have been able to see much of the old town grow into a more upscale, urban vibe to it that sort of meshes well with the dusty, tumbleweed blowing across the street scene that it is.  Confusing and sort of awesome all in one, the little old street in Gilbert has become a place of choice not only for me, but throngs of east valley residents as well.  There are too many good places to eat in this area and this is a good problem.  
The review:
Liberty has been a place I have been ordering take-out from for over two years now and my actual dine-in experience has been minimal. Parking is reasonable though can at times be difficult with Postino's, Joe's, and Oregano's all smashed together.  Phone-in orders are always courteous, almost always fully accurate with special order types, and the wait has never been prolonged.  The restaurant is clean and just fun to look at.  
Food is delicious.  I have not sampled the entire menu but it is varied and well thought out.  Pricey?  Maybe.  I have learned that more imaginative and fresh food equals a more premium price and for the most part, I accept this.  
As a creature of habit, I can speak on the salmon blt with authority; never fishy, good char on the bun, bacon is always delicious, tomatoes are thick and red.  Sandwiches are clever with designer cheese and excellent breads.  Homemade kettle-styled chips = yum!  
Breakfast is also varied and delicious.  
Coffee bar:  This is my favorite region of  Liberty.  I have shed the Starbucks addiction and moved to more local coffee houses that can replicate a good cappuccino.  Liberty can do this to my satisfaction.  The baristas are knowledgeable and friendly.  They will remember your order and chat with you if not too busy.  Adult coffee drinks?  Sign me up.  
I love this place.  I want to move in to this place.  I dislike people.  Herein lies the problem.  The times I can visit are always peak when there are throngs of 
obnoxious humans and the acoustics are terrible.  Navigating the Yukon models of strollers to a table is an exercise in patience and contortion; space between tables is at a premium.  
Is this a place to quietly work on your laptop with a cup of coffee? Depends on the time.  Is this a place to get an excellent coffee drink?  Yes.  Food is delicious and the atmosphere is engaging.  
Pros:  Food and coffee drinks; decor and yes, bathrooms have character.
Cons:  (Peak hours) Parking, too much humanity in one establishment, acoustics.

354,1178,,"Tao is one of the most beautiful and spacious clubs I have ever been in. Seriously, it is like the best feast for your eyes. In every way this could be a place out of a movie. The cool and trendy Asian fusion inspired place where a major scene occurs. 

But the thing is, you can't enjoy it at all. The line outside is insane, there must have been 1000 people in line when we got there at 11:30pm. Then we managed to cut the line due to the ""finesse"" of some guys we met in the casino. As soon as you get in, you are literally shoulder to shoulder with someone. I guess I'm lucky to be decently tall for an Asian girl, otherwise I might have suffocated in shoulders. Not only that, they totally skimp on the air cond. I mean seriously, Vegas is HOT, the only reason to go clubbing in Vegas, vs the normal home town is that you expect the eye candy to be better and to finally by graced by the presence of being cooled from the heat. But it was cooler outside the club in the middle of summer that is how hot it was. It was so dark and crowded I couldn't make out any candy. Then the dance floor was packed, literally the only thing one could try to do to dance is jump up and down. 

Lame. The one thing was that the drinks were ok, but drinks can pretty much be ok anywhere you go. I would totally pass on Tao, if it weren't so pretty inside and the music wasn't decent, which it was, I would have given it one star.",2008-08-19 08:43:50

1682,845,,"I am writing this with both respect and frustration for this restaurant. Having spent time in the UK, I was familiar with the famous ""meal in a pastry"" that originates from the mining town of Cornwall. 

Few restaurants compare when it comes to simplicity and variety. I have become addicted to the cajun with it's spicy chicken, ham, and cheesy goodness. My girlfriend always seems to order the veggie tikka masala. I have tried much of the menu, and as long as you stay with the pasties, you are fine. The potato dishes are sort of hit and miss. The cheesy one is sort of bland  and the curried potato lacks the crunchiness that would otherwise put it on a great tapas menu. Finally, I would add that the beer selection is quite good and offers several sizes of great draft beers from the British Isles.

So yeah, food is great, and for dine in the prices are decent. My big frustration, and the reason I am writing this has to do with my experience tonight. I have taken to ordering pasties to go because the wait staff is often slow or inattentive. This is normally fine because I can stay at home and watch a movie while I eat. Indeed, I have been trying to save money by ordering half-baked pasties, and in the past they have knocked a dollar off of each of the pasties I've ordered regardless of type. Tonight I ordered two half-baked pasties to take home and the woman operating the cash register refused to give me the usual dollar off. Very, very annoying and this is the sort of inconsistency in the staff that keeps me from awarding five stars. Food=great, service=less than stellar.",2010-08-20 07:26:52

Their cookies are great, they have a few to choose from. I've had their cupcakes (no one would ever know the difference!), brownies I've tried both the regular and salted caramel- yum! I've tried their donuts and while the texture isn't exactly like a gluten-filled donut, I'll take it!! It has great chocolate glaze on it. Their waffles are very golden and crispy and the syrup/butter sauce that comes with them is what makes the dish. I get potatoes and eggs almost every time I go.y favorite things to get at Jewel's are the flax bread (have them slice a loaf and freeze it to keep - if it'll last that long!!) and the MAGIC BARS! Just get there early because the magic bars will sell out! They also sell GF cookie and bread mixes, as well as frozen items for a little cheaper. Cute little outside patio for nice days and my boyfriend loves the coffee and some breakfast items (he's not GF but still loves it here).

962,24,,"I hate buffets. I almost never I try a buffet that is even remotely passable in terms of quality, taste and preparation. The Buffet at the Bellagio is one of those exceptions; in fact it by far surpasses any buffet I have ever found. 

Here you will find a huge selection of food, anything from beef, pork, lamb, seafood and even vegetarian. Everything I sampled would rival entrees from most any sit down restaurant you will find. For me the highlight was the Alaskan King Crab legs, they were perfectly cooked, large, meaty and pre-split. It's rare that I find crab of this quality. I find the prime rib equally prepared, cooked to a perfectly medium rare. The various pork and chicken dishes were excellent. Of the vegetable sides I sampled the mashed potatoes (real potatoes), green beans, corn, salad, etc., all were delicious. Of the few breads I sampled were also very good. In short this was a buffet that really was one of the best meals I had had in quite a while, I left satisfied and overstuffed. 

Now the bad, at just under $40 it's quite expensive. It's also a good idea to try and arrive just about opening, the lines can get quite long. Given the quality and variety of food it really isn't a bad deal in my view. Just make sure you're hungry when you go. For a buffet The Buffet it's as good as it gets.",2013-10-24 15:19:09

1291,470,,"I have been holding back recently on giving out 5 stars reviews but for the dinner I had last week at Citizen Public House, I gladly give them all 5. My dinner was outstanding. My husband has been there before and was raving about this place. He has been to Scottsdale 3x and has said that all 3x have been great. This says alot since the menu is ever-changing with the exception of a few favorites that are always on the menu (chopped salad and noble bread with some type of jam). 

We made a quick reservation on Open Table and although we got there on time, we still had to wait a bit for our table. Not sure why as there were empty tables around, maybe they just had to catch up on things from earlier. Not sure.

We elected to have 5 starters versus any entrees because we couldn't choose between all the starters we wanted. Wow - so glad we made that choice because all 5 were great! 

What we got:
- Pork Belly Pastrami (my husband's favorite) - the meat was crispy and tender and the brussels sprout sauerkraut was really good
- Burrata - least fave of all the appetizers but still really good. i think this dish would be great if we didn't have to compare it to the other 4 dishes. The cheese is pasteurized per the waiter which is great because I am pregnant, but was able to eat it. Very fresh and creamy.
- Noble Bread Plate with bacon jam and black garlic butter - this was MY fave!!! geeez, i could have licked the plate. I am on a mission to learn to make this dish because I am so sad i cannot eat this every day of my life. I love bread but that jam and butter were just whoa...
- Chopped salad - really good although it is exactly the same as the original stetson salad at Cowboy Ciao. Nevertheless, still yummy and a real real good salad.
- Fried grit catfish - Yummy! The outside crust was really crispy and held onto the fish. Good portions. The cucumber relish that came with it was amazing too.

Not much else I can say. Service was good but the quality of the food was the star. Even though we only got starters, the portions were very fair and we were really full at the end of the night. We are planning to go back to Scottsdale next year (we are from SF) and this place will be on the top of our list of restaurants to eat!",2018-04-02 22:57:12

In addition, I always get the yucca fries; my lunch order is now a burrito with yucca fries and all for under $10 and i can't finish it all.  In addition, always get the green sauce and use it to your heat tolerance.  It definitely has a kick to it, so mix it with some mayo especially for the yucca fries.

112,1072,,"We each ordered something different. The salmon, the veal and Coq au vin. Each plate was delectable. The oysters were smaller than what I've had elsewhere but that horseradish was delish& kicks like a kung-fu flick.  The French onion soup was tasty ( I didn't try it personally) but it looked rich and there wasn't much left when she finished. 
The service was orchestrated and flowed smoothly. I'm know baguette is the ""official"" bread but to us it was hard as a hockey puck. Hard to enjoy. But c'est la vie!  The menu often changes because what's on their website come Monday was NOT the menu presented to us this past Saturday. My father raved about the veal being EXTREMELY tender and it was! He was contemplating ordering another Veau to Go. (Such a greedy b@stard but it WAS SO GOOD, I would've helped him finish it back at the hotel) 
My Coq au Vin fell apart when it put my fork to it. I wanted more mushrooms-- so I ate my dads mushrooms & he actually got mad. I mean we're suppose to be sharing. 
That's when you know it's delicous-- when people STOP sharing their food & START hoarding their own plate from others. 
We've never seen salmon prepared this way. It broke apart when we put a fork in it. There were pomegranates in the sauce!! Such a perfect mixture of seafood and bursts of pomegrante juices. You think it wouldn't mix well-- au contraire mon amis- you would be so wrong.

The place is clean & comfortable, with a nice ambiance and we've always had good service (even on crazy fight nights when the placed is packed).  We have found the prices to be a little high for a sports bar style menu, but when you consider they don't charge a cover fee for UFC events & sometimes have coupons, it's not too bad.

The food isn't 5 star amazing, but it's pretty solid for a joint like this.  We've tried probably about half the stuff on the menu in the years we've been visiting Augie's.  For the appetizers, the egg-roll-wrapped mozz sticks & pretzel sticks are the best of the bunch.  Their wings are run-of-the-mill & sadly they don't offer variable heat levels on the buffalo style (it's a soft medium IMO).  The burgers & sandwiches are mostly good, but not exceptional.  The best things on the menu are the ribs & pizza.  The ribs are baked/grilled style rather than smoked, but they're super tender with a sweet sauce & fall off the bone.  The pizza is probably our favorite thing at Augie's.  If fact, I'd even say I was kinda shocked at how good it was when we first tried it.  The crust is a bit bready, but it really works with the sauce & cheese they use.  It's definitely worth a try.  Pro tip - order it ""well done"" to get a nice slightly charred edge.  For dessert, the chocolate brownie sundae thing is surprisingly awesome.  It's simple, but good & surely plentiful.

All in all, we're lucky to have a joint like this out in the far west valley.  They have friendly service, show UFC fights for free, and the food is above-average for this kind of place.",2016-01-04 15:51:48

Crab curry--takes like ocean-flavored red curry. And with little nests of vermicelli noodles, it's a must-try.

I found the menu to be a bit underwhelming. My friend and I ordered the polenta fries, warm Brie with poached pear, a french onion soup, and a veggie burger- all to share. The polenta fries were tasteless and not at all appetizing. The French onion soup was decent (not the best I've had but not the worst either), the veggie burger was just okay (also kind of bland), but the warm Brie with poached pear was phenomenal and the best part of our meal! 

If it wasn't for the warm Brie then I would say our meal would have been a total bust, but luckily the warm Brie dish redeemed our entire culinary experience at this place.

The potato side had good flavor but the potatoes were undercooked and hard in the middle.

The table was right by the entrance and my seat was right behind the menu where people walking by could check it out.  I didn't really like that table b/c a lot of people were walking by and then they were right next to the table looking at the menu.

Other than, that the food was excellent!  They gave us bread and olive oil, which was so good b/c we had two basket-fulls.  I ordered the sea bass and a side of potatoes and was completely stuffed.  I also had a glass of wine, which was great!

1228,920,,"Wanted a convenient place to eat lunch that was near our hotel and Lemongrass seemed to fit our budget. The restaurant has fancy décor and ambience due to location inside the Aria I'm guessing. It's spacious inside and there wasn't much people dining in at the same time as us so it was pretty nice and quiet.

Food was mediocre. It reminded me of an Asian mix between Thai and Chinese cuisine, except very overpriced. They also serve dim sum, but my party was not interested. We all ordered and shared a variety of plates, which included the below:

Crispy Marinated Squid $12

Wonton Noodle Soup $16

Young Chow Fried Rice $18

Thai Crab Omelette $19

Honey Walnut Shrimp $25

I've been to traditional Chinese restaurants and had similar if not better Wonton Noodle Soup and Honey Walnut Shrimp for half the cost that Lemongrass charges. Wish they added more wontons and vegetables alongside the noodles in the soup. The rice, squid and shrimp served as decent fillers for lunch. I did not care for the thai crab omelette, but because my tablemate was hungry - she finished it.

Perhaps we ordered the wrong menu items and should have gotten more 'Thai' dishes. As Lemongrass is generally known for their Thai cuisine, maybe we messed up by ordering Chinese here. It was not worth the money. Safe to say, I won't be dining here again if I do see myself back at Aria.",2017-11-11 07:20:05

639,592,,"I should preface this review by saying that I am a vegetarian and do not eat seafood. I asked our waiter what vegetarian options they had, and he suggested the tofu toban yaki and vegetables for $30. I asked if there were any off menu items, and the chef told him there was a tofu with cantaloupe salad also for $30. I ordered the latter, and there must have been some miscommunication because it ended up being so small, I wouldn't even call it an appetizer. I'm surprised they both cost $30 for such vastly different amounts of food. I promptly called our waiter over, and he willingly switched my entree for the tofu toban yaki and vegetable stir fry. This ended up being cooked in flamed sake, and it had a rich sake flavor, which I think was pretty unique. However, I'm kind of disappointed and feel ripped off that I essentially paid $30 for tofu and vegetable stir fry that didn't even include unique vegetables. Ultimately, it kind of sucked that my girlfriend and I weren't able to eat at the same time.

My girlfriend ordered their black cod, one of their signature dishes, which she loved. This was a large piece of fish cooked well and included their miso sauce. 

I personally would not go back nor recommend this place to somebody who doesn't eat seafood. If you eat seafood, you'll probably like the food, but be prepared to pay out the wazoo.",2014-12-22 23:03:03

Checking in was a breeze, via the self check-in kiosks.

Room: Clean as it could be, but obviously, not top-notch like the higher-end hotels as this hotel is a bit dated and rundown.

The standard room I purchased was on the 4th floor, so relatively quiet. Minor eye sore was the broken top drawer, by the bed, that would not close - slight OCD annoyance, but managed to make it through 2 nights with it. Room comes with an empty fridge and coffee maker.

563,854,,"They finally have a kids menu!!!  We used to go to Cheesecake all the time with our kids.  We basically got sick of paying for adult entrees for our kiddos and family dinner out would cost well over $100.  Cheesecake is not a place that my husband and I would choose if we were out alone.  So aside from the occasional lunch salad while shopping or getting cheesecake to-go, we haven't been here in a long time.

My #3 son chose Cheesecake for his birthday dinner.  Items ordered included calamari (same at all chains), fried mac and cheese appetizer (delish), Chicken Maderia (sweet, tender chicken), Low-calorie chicken and asparagus (boring, but served it's purpose), 4 cheese pasta with chicken(huge portion, but again same as any chain), buffalo blaster (fried  boneless chicken wing something), kids quesadilla (over priced for tortilla and cheese), farmhouse cheese burger (good, not great).

We had 4 cheesecakes...Key lime, red velvet, apple caramel struesel, reeses peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake.  All were FANTASTIC!

The cheesecake will always be the 1 thing that keeps us coming back.  I still think everything is overpriced, but at least they are consistent. 

Service was good this time.  When we left, they were on a wait, but there were tables open everywhere.  Clearly a staffing issue, but I am sure frustrating to customers.",2011-01-20 02:34:42
1424,454,,"I consider myself a connoisseur of corned beef hash, finding myself ordering it almost every breakfast restaurant I go, often being greatly disappointed with the dog food-like slop I am frequently served which is lacking in color, flavor, and texture.  

However, my trip to Rise & Shine a steak and egg place provided me with one of the best corned beef hash entrees I've ever had. The pulled corned beef had a great sear on it with a nice malliard browning along with some caramelized onions, red skin potatoes, and two eggs over easy and I was in corned beef nirvana.  The owners really spent some time perfecting this simple yet amazing dish.

The place is quaint with a creative decor and spinning umbrellas line the ceiling, a friendly homey staff and lavazza coffee, fresh pressed orange juice made fresh daily make it a breakfast spot not to miss!

Got there just in time for the tail end of ""Recess"" (aka Happy Hour).  Decent variety of drink and appetizer specials, with enough that should cover everyone's tastes.  Bartenders were very knowledgeable and very friendly, even though it was PACKED.

Dinner, things just got better, we tried the fried Coli-flour, as has been reviewed here many times.  It was really good, but what outdid it was the bacon cheddar tater tots.  YUM!  For my main, I had Bangers and Mash.  Really good, the sausages were excellent, though not quite true to the English form of B&M, but still VERY good.  My wife had the Roasted Pablano, she's not a vegetarian, but  it would have worked, and it was delicious to boot!

Our friend had the Short Rib, which he reported was out of this world good.  His wife had the Shrimp and White Cheddar grits.  Best grits I've ever tried.

The second time I visited Gold and Silver, Pawn Stars was becoming extremely popular. The place was going through a renovation and my mother and I brought in some scrap metals to sell at market price. The man we met with was kind and courteous and even gave us a signed photo of Rick Harrison and The Old Man. Overall it was a pleasant experience.

On out last trip however we decided to visit the shop again since the show is now the #1 show on cable. What we encountered was an extremely rude staff and absolutely no courtesy as potential buyers. The man behind the counter was extremely rude to my mother and in my book, that's not acceptable.

The onions and peppers were not even cooked just a little burnt from sticking to the skillet. The homemade guacamole was good but the tortillas tasted like plastic. My friend was visiting from out of town and I am a local but I don't mind going to places on the strip if it is worth it. This place is not. The music was loud and the show of dancing guys on stilts making animal balloons did not impress me. My friend got the island pork wrap and said it was ok but not worth coming back for.

I always get an order of the seitan wings with vegan buffalo sauce and vegan ranch (get extra). The pizza is awesome! They have a wide variety of veg-friendly pizza toppings, including pepperoni, sausage, and daiya mozzarella and cheddar. 

The first time I went here (with my husband and kids in tow), I didn't realize that there was very limited seating, so be prepared to take out. In warm weather, it gets very hot inside the restaurant due to the ovens, so you may not want to sit inside anyway. There are a couple of benches outside on the sidewalk that people sit at to eat. Also, sometimes there is a long wait time, so call early. We usually order and bring it home, pop it onto a pizza stone and heat it back up. Still delicious and worth the drive for us.

The service is always friendly and they are always happy to answer questions about toppings, ingredients, etc.

We were incredibly happy with our purchase. As first time homebuyers and moving from out of state we were literally and mentally in new territory. His team walked us through every step of the process and we were able to get something great for our growing family within our budget in such a competitive market.

What really stood out was how the sale of our home went. We had already made a few minor upgrades to the property, but when it came time to sell, Bill gave us a few pointers to polish up the place. Using all of his recommended vendors, we were able to accomplish this in a short time and for low cost. He appropriately read the market and priced our home reasonably, and we ended up selling our home within a few days and walked away with an extra $30,000 cash in our pockets.

- my friend's bachelorette weekend in Vegas; this place was suggested to us by one of the cab drivers 
- because we were told this is a classic, the bride had everyone dress pin-up for our meal here

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- in Old Vegas I believe, so farther down the popular area that people frequent on the strip

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- very old school diner throughout the main area; the lounge/bar area with the indoor bonfire was legit though and brought upon a different atmosphere

THE MENU:
- traditional club breakfasts
- Peppermill breakfast favorites
- breakfast sides
- Peppermill omelets
- pancakes and waffles
- appetizers
- soups and salads
- sandwiches
- burgers
- steaks
- entrees
- desserts
- beverages, fruits & cereals
- wine
- beer

WHAT I ORDERED (I can't speak for everyone because I don't recall):

Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.

I never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).

The restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times), but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu, signature cocktails, wines by the glass, bottles that are sold by the glass, and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day, all night. 

We frequented the happy hour several times during our trip, and we were stoked every visit.  

We plan on making this our home next time we stop in Vegas.  It's the perfect getaway off the Strip.",2013-10-24 03:17:56

We went the Saturday before and it was excellent and then we went back on Xmas and it was horrible. The previous Xmas the same thing. Only good thing I noticed this time is that now you can pay the extra for the unlimited champagne any time, any day. Xmas 2011 I waited in line for 4 hours, past the 3:00 cut-off for champagne but just in time for the higher dinner price and lousy food. And no one said at the end of the line the expected wait time.

812,24,,"When me and my family came to Las Vegas, we decided to go to at least one of these fancy buffets no matter how expensive it may be. However, we were sorely disappointed and regretted it. 

First, way too expensive. It is like $50 per person. If the food was good, I wouldn't be complaining about the price, but it wasn't. The food are just average. You can get pretty much all this food anywhere if you look just look it up on yelp. 

Second, food ran out. Since this is a famous buffet, I was expecting to be able to try all the ""delicious"" food. However, half of the desserts ran out. I was there around 6pm, so it wasn't even around closing time. There was no macaroons, creme brulee, and flan. Pretty much all the desserts that I wanted to try out, but wasn't able to.

Lastly, the quality of ingredients. The sushi are not fresh. The sushi I buy at sushi restaurants back in Michigan is a lot fresher and they are way cheaper than here. The fruits are not fresh too. The quality of the pizza are similar to the pizza domino has, but heck a lot cheaper.

Overall, don't come here. You can fine better tasting food elsewhere that is actually satisfying.",2018-08-03 20:59:17

This place is amazing! It is a very small dining room/bar but the atmosphere is outstanding.  It's more of an experience than it is just dinner.

Everyone talks about the guacamole and for good reason. We ordered the guacamole sampler and chose 3 of their unique guacs: 1) Smoked trout and bacon 2) Jicama and Pineapple and 3) Crab, corn and chipotle.  (Side note: pretty much every other table also had a sampler. It's that good!) I'm sure you can read a ton of reviews on the guacamole so let me talk about the food...

When we arrived we were told it was happy hour and the ""taquitos"" were half off.  We decided to just get 4 different orders of taquitos.  Oh my am I glad we did! We had duck, pork, boar and beef.  There are not a lot of places where you can get a selection like that!  All the meats were unbelievably savory.  Each meat came with a special homemade sauce which added even more flavor to an already spectacular dish.

I cannot write a review without mentioning the corn tortillas.  These tortillas are spot on to the tortillas I used to devour while living in Mexico. Great flavor and remarkably fresh.  They were the perfect compliment to the different meats and sauces.

Finally, I must mention the service.  The first impression is not the strongest due to rather unwelcoming hostesses.  However, our waiter quickly made us forget about the cold welcome.  He truly made this an experience for us. Friendly, engaging, informative and very attentive. I think he was waiting on every table in the restaurant but he never left us waiting and was on top of everything including refills.

The fried calamari reminded me of the way my mother makes them.  Perfectly cooked and a very light batter.  Salad was delicious with just right amount of dressing.  
Risotto was well prepared with great flavor from the shrimp and hint of lemon.  
The orechiette was prepared al dente with a light red sauce infused with the lobster and shrimp.  Yummy!

Try the chicken biscuits as an appetizer - it only comes with 2 so make sure you get at least two orders. I got the wedge salad with shrimp but the shrimp were way overcooked. Try the bone marrow as an appetizer as well!

They were all out of a shrimp macaroni and cheese, which was the special of the day, so that was unfortunate. Literally a few minutes before that the waiter announced that they had that on the menu and then he had to come back and tell us that they ran out so he should've been a little more prepared.

My husband loves the Dutch baby pancake - not many places have them and you have to allow for 30 minutes for it to cook, but it's delicious. I've had eggs and sausage: the eggs are light and fluffy and very good. The sausage is good too, and the hash browns are fresh and more like thinly sliced fried potatoes than a grated potato square you might get other places. I've also had the blueberry pancakes - so addictive and I appreciate that the blueberries are in the compote as well as inside the batter. The Buffalo chicken wrap that I tried yesterday was the best I've ever had. The wrap/tortilla was fresh and not too thick; the lettuce, tomato and cheese were all fresh, and the chicken was flavorful and seasoned just right with the hot sauce. Usually the hot sauce is poured in and drops out when you eat it, but this one had the hot sauce applied to the chicken before it was added to the wrap, which makes for a much cleaner and more welcome eating experience. Oh, and it came with house-made potato chips and ranch dipping sauce - also yum!",2016-12-31 19:58:18

1242,1035,,"While in Vegas for a friend's birthday, we decided to have a nice dinner and settled on steak. After reading about Mastro's, I made a reservation, and we were seated in the large wooden structure thing. Screw it, I'm just gonna go straight to the steak.

When our waiter mentioned that their special was an A5 grade 33oz. wagyu tomahawk, I was sold. It's basically a thick cut, bone-in ribeye, and I knew I was in for something special just by looking at it. The first thing that immediately caught my attention was the rim - it was HUMUNGADUNGA. Normally, the rim just encircles the outer edge of about half the eye, but this rim was almost the same size as the eye! Why is this such a big deal? Of all the steak cuts, the rim of the ribeye is the absolute BEST tasting piece in the entire beef carcass. I always separate it from the rest of the ribeye so I can save it for last. The muscle fibers in the rim are very loosely bound, and marbling of ribeyes is second to none. What this means is that you have a piece of meat that's super tender (just as tender as a filet), super juicy, and super flavorful, which perfectly describes the wagyu tomahawk. Each bite was a blast of rich and savory goodness. The juices coat your mouth in a sheen of happiness. There truly is nothing to criticize. The only thing I could wish for is that they serve just the rim as its own cut of steak.

You make a reservation for a room like us as we had a reservation for a non smoking king room and when we got to the front desk they told us that they only had queen beds in which they can't guarantee that you will get what you booked for as that is not at all the way to do business. They also tried to charge us for the room in which we were not going to stay in at all unless we got what we wanted as I had to fight the hotel manager for a full refund. A reservation should guarantee exactly what kind of room you are requesting with no if's and or butts.

424,1051,,"Was pretty excited to return to Vegas this time around...My first trip here was eh. And we never did make it to Freemont Street. Not only do I love a good party, but I'm also a history buff and wanted to see the old places on what used to be the strip.

Went with my mother in law this time around, and got to check it out! Was so glad we did!! In fact, we spent all 3 nights on Freemont, finding our way home in the wee hours of the morning!

While she gambled, I checked out the show on their little strip. And not just the one in the sky...although that was pretty amazing as well. Loved their Doors tribute, and seeing the Zipliners fly through periodically!

What grabbed my attention the most was the bands. Love a good cover band...and they had a few of them...at one time! Grabbed myself one of the huge arse drinks they sold, and went out there to check one out. Entertaining, Rocky...and a bit too flashy for my liking...so I started giving the singer crap in the middle of a Guns and Roses song...was up front, so would shake my head no...or shrug my shoulders, like eh...caught his attention, because he would try something different each time until I found myself really enjoying his singing - but then again, it just may have been that margaretta!! 

The second day, I found myself talking to the entertainers that frequent the street. Adjusting the ballerina's sash, explaining to MJ how great he looks... considering! Great place to people watch...talked with a few other out of towners, some locals and checked out Rock of Ages...who was cheesy fun!! 
This time around, I was smarter about my drinks...while browsing through the selection of gift shops there, noticed they had a good selection of booze at the shop. Picked me up a super sized beer for $3 and went out to enjoy the sights! Did that 2x that night...save my money for other things!! Like my amazing piece of art I bought from a street vendor. Yeah, so I got suckered...but my spiderman is absolutely amazing!! 

Third night, was a bit bored of the scene, but still had a kick ass time. DeNero was giving me crap...there was another MJ on the scene, and the ballerina looked in much worse shape then the night before. ZZ Top (impersonators) were playing the main stage, and my band from the night before in the back. More people watching, drinking - found my new favorite at the Whisky bar - Honey Jack, Sprite and twist of lemon - so good!! 

Did manage to check out the Nugget while I was here, had to go in! Absolutely LOVE their pool. Just wished I had checked them out before eating that night...was looking for sushi, and being rushed to get down there, didn't have a chance to find a place! Did eat a very good Italian dinner that night on Freemont...their Veal was probably some of the best I've had in a long time.

Freemont really made my trip fun and interesting! The bus ride back to the hotel every night was always fun!! But, can't say I recommend doing more then 2 days...really wished we hung out on the strip that last night so I can explore more there...but, that's what the next trip is for...right?!",2012-06-26 04:32:54

1429,557,,"Located off the strip in Downtown Las Vegas, the crowd and vibes are way more relaxed. 
This spot was a little tricky to find but when we finally did, we were so glad we didn't give up! 
One of the employees met us outside and recognized our look of confusion and showed us the way.

We were seated indoors right away at a communal high top table because we desperately needed AC. But if you love the sun, you can eat on the outdoor rooftop patio and bar. 

The first thing I noticed were the actual menus which were so unique. I immediately knew that the food would be amazing because if someone puts that much thought into a menu, then they've definitely put a lot of thought and care into crafting delicious cocktails and dishes.

We ordered the Machu Peach-U cocktail. It was a peachy take on a Peruvian Pisco sour, with Smith & Cross Jamaica rum, Giffard crème de pêche, Barso pisco, fresh lemon & lime, bar keep saffron bitters, and finished with a fluffy egg white on top. I loved it!

Our first appetizer was the KILLER SHRIMP with rocoto & aji amarillo pepper cream. It looked and tasted similarly to Walnut Shrimp from a Chinese restaurant, minus the walnuts, and had a spicy kick at the end.  

Our second app were the PORK WINGS with buffalo bleu beurre blanc. They were the most succulent juicy pork belly bites dipped in a little buffalo sauce. They were finger licking good!!

Next we ordered the baked mac n cheese. I'm not sure what cheeses were used but it was creamy, dreamy, delicious. 

Our entrée was the COCOA-ESPRESSO NY STRIP with red wine demi. It was perfection! I couldn't distinguish the cocoa or espresso flavors, but they must've worked well together because I took pleasure in each juicy bite. 

Dessert... Oh, my...
I love donuts. I love bread pudding. And yes, 
they actually made a GLAZED DONUT BREAD PUDDING!!!! It was almost shaped like a mushroom- the top was donut and it became softer at the base, almost like flan. I had the biggest smile of sheer bliss on my face and I closed my eyes to make the flavors and that feeling last as long as possible.

When we arrived, the line was practically out the door. We thought we'd have to wait an hour but the line went quickly. 

Soooo much food for a decent price. I ordered the Kalua Pork & Cabbage and shared a bowl of Poke. OMG they were both delicious. I was only able to finish half my plate. 

I was a tiny bit disappointed on the dessert choices available. I was hoping (and craving) to see Chantilly, Haupia (coconut) and Hawaiian Rainbow cakes. I'll overlook this minor problem go, other than that, I'll definitely be back again.",2011-12-20 17:40:55

The service was nothing special. Our server had no personality and seemed bored. I ordered a pizza with pistachios, parmesan and red onions and my boyfriend ordered some kind of BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza was dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. It wasn't AWFUL, but it wasn't REMARKABLE either. We left unimpressed and don't really have any craving to go back there again.

There was absolutely no room for dancing; however, there was some standing room if you don't mind being pushed out of the way for people passing by. Luckily we were invited into a VIP section stocked with Dom and Belvedere. There was plenty of room and the bottle service crew was on top of their game! The LED chandelier was pretty neat and the dancers/acrobats which come down from the ceiling were impressive. Calvin Harris came on stage pretty late, but it was still a great time!

But the reason I stopped going there and the low rating is because this place is NOT what it seems. It is not a ""family friendly"" place for people to come and relax, it is a place for homosexuals to come meet each other. I found this out one day in the steam room when a man sitting on the floor removed his towel and started masturbating. I immediately walked out and went to the locker room. Out of the 6 or so men that were in the steam room, I was the only one to leave. I changed and let the people at the front desk know about it. They apologized and wished me a good night but didn't look like they were about to do anything else. If you're not into that sort of thing then I'd suggest you stay far away.",2018-02-12 02:39:29

We also ordered the chips with the roasted Roja salsa. 
The corn tortillas were outstanding and held up so well to the filling. I found the sauteed spinach-mushroom combo to be okay, not anything too flavorful. The guacamole needed something more, in my opinion. If I am going to eat guacamole while visiting AZ, I have high expectations. I thought it was bland. The chips were also okay. So, my meal was good but nothing that would bring me back in a hurry. I will say the enchiladas looked delicious.

Phillip was a great waiter and offered great suggestions and information regarding the menu.

If you let your waiter know that you are celebrating a special occasion, they will give you a free drink or dessert. We celebrated my friend's birthday there and got a free plate of mochi and fruity ice cream.

860,1172,,"StripSteak is the ultimate in artery clogging indulgence.    Dry aged steaks, poached in clarified butter and cooked on wood fired grills.  Yes, I said poached in butter.  The steak is first heated in warm BUTTER before it is grilled.   This process results in the richest, most tender, most flavorful steak I have ever had.  I'm sure the cut of steak we chose also helped, we both had the ribeye cap.  The cap is the ultra rich and soft outside layer of the ribeye.  The part that I normally save for last because I like it so much.  This is the only place I've ever heard of that serves just the cap.  It was amazing!   

We also had the foie gras sliders, the foie was great, but I thought that the other accoutrements took away from its flavor.  The duck fat fries were delicious, especially the truffled ones.  The mac and cheese was great, super rich with plenty of truffle oil.   

As if all this wasn't enough, we topped it off with warm beignets topped with creme brulee, a fittingly rich and delicious dessert.

I am writing this two days after my dinner and I am happy to say that I did not suffer any type of heart attack and plan on returning to stripsteak next time I am in Vegas.

Tip - Make sure to get on open table and make a reservation if you plan to eat at a specific time. The dinning room section isn't huge and can fill up fast. When we walked in at 8:30 on a Friday night, it was a 1.5 hour wait. 
We ordered the Shrimp and grits, Chicken, Waffles and Watermelon, side of Mac n' Cheese, order of deviled eggs, and order of biscuits. let's just say we over did it....considering this was food for four people.

1394,1161,,"If I've learned anything watching countless hours of travel shows focused around food (Zimmern/Bourdain mostly) it is that visiting the market in a city is one of the best ways to see their food culture concentrated into one location. Making an effort to hit up the markets in my travels has been an enjoyable pastime and the West Side Market was no exception.

The building that the market is housed in is beautiful from the outside and even more stunning from the inside. What an amazing view when you walk in! Even with the hordes of people there on a Saturday morning, the interior had a sense of openness because of the high arched brick ceilings. 

A great selection of food vendors all around the building including a bunch of meat vendors, baked goods, pastas and plenty of ready to eat goods. I ended up sampling some really good falafel, some ok tamales, a couple different versions of meat sticks and some tasty baked dessert treats to bring back to my girlfriend. 

The place is maze like with all the people filling the aisles and not knowing the layout very well. I ended up doubling back a few times to make sure I saw everything from every angle I could. At some point, I ended up exiting the main building and discovering the produce section that I didn't even know was there! A long row of vendors on both sides filled with fruits and veggies of all kinds. I wouldn't call it the best selection I've seen but it was definitely serviceable and the prices seemed quite fair.

Next time I'm in Cleveland I'm definitely making another stop to learn more about this architectural and food destination.",2012-10-25 00:40:08

Their season potatoes are delicious and their drink options are fantastic. 

On a previous visit, I had asked the server if they served passion fruit iced tea. He asked me what types of fruit I liked and prepared a mango flavored tea that was a hit. The servers are highly attentive and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. It feels as though you are eating at a friend's home.

So onto the food. The bananas foster waffle is light and delicious. I must get this everytime now. The spinach and goat cheese omlette was fluffy and cooked to perfection.  I love crepes but I really didn't like the pancakes they were nice and light just needed a little sweetness in the batter for my taste. I can see how many would like them.  The fruit bouquet is great to share and very fresh. Coffee is good and they keep it flowing. Date glazed bacon a must if you like bacon. My hubby got the corned beef hash and they use nice big pieces of freshly cooked corned beef it was very good and top quality not greasy. The muffins are great as well.

Our server, whose name I unfortunately forget (I blame Vegas brain, hard to remember), was amazing.  He recommended a Saki that was delicious, and he even offered us tastings of sashimi and another type of Saki on the house!  He truly went above and beyond what I would expect from a dining experience in Vegas, let alone anywhere else.

Ok, so I hadn't really been planning on eating seared scallops at 9:30 in the morning, but sometimes you just gotta go with the flow.

Though I've heard this is not the biggest buffet in town, my husband and I both found more than enough food to keep our mouths and bellies happy.  I ate so much seafood, I thought I was going to grow a gill.  He focused more on the more breakfasty things and reported only good things.

My husband is diabetic and so was very happy to see several sugar-free options on the dessert table.

Service was good.  We took advantage of the champagne because it was included in the cost of the meal and, after all, it was Sunday.  The waiter kept our glasses filled.  I appreciated that, when I asked for more tea, he brought me a whole new pot of hot water and tea bag, instead of just pouring lukewarm water onto my already used bag.

We were greated promptly by Tracy, lovely bartender. Had the Bennett and bubbles that I have wanted to try, it was awesome, not too sweet, refreshing and perfect to pair with my beet and goat cheese salad. Great salad, the mandarin oranges complimented the bitter arugula perfectly. My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese. He enjoyed both and I tried the mac, it was yummie, pasta cooked just right and thick sauce. The manager was very nice, we chatted about the drinks and their new location in North Scottsdale. We will definitely be back to see Tracy for Saturday brunch. She is wonderful, genuine, fantastic service. She anticipated our possible needs and has a warm smile. Thank you!",2017-06-02 22:26:15

The bar offers a nice variety of single-malt scotch, cognac, and even a few armagnacs. One of the bartenders, Dale, knows his spirits well and has a knack for remembering his customers. The drink prices are also quite reasonable. 

The bread baskets are generously full and pair well with every sauce on the menu. We're partial to the bread with kalamata olives baked in, because seriously, they're kalamata olives! No further explanation required. :)

We've enjoyed the following dishes:

- Scallop in cream sauce with crab/shrimp (Perfect dish, esp. with the bread.)
- Halibut cheeks (Rich and delicious.)
- Filet Mignon (This isn't a steakhouse, but they still do a pretty good job on this one.)
- Salmon Wellington (Try as you might, you simply cannot eat it all.)

Ultimately, we find our way back to the scallops with cream sauce. It's our favorite dish, and it never fails to amaze.

We always enjoy top-notch service, food, and spirits in this restaurant. What a blessing to live a mile from there! :)

NOISE-SENSITIVE DINERS: When making your reservation, find out if large parties are seated at the same time or in the same room as your table. Noise is a problem as this restaurant is underground and the walls reflect everything. Try to book during off-peak hours if you can. We love this place, but we love it because we eat outside of peak hours. 

^^^ Parents with screaming children, or children with screaming parents: Take note and book your reservations during happy hour. :-)

SUV DRIVERS: The parking lot is small and offers little maneuverability; especially during happy hour. Parking on the side street is your best bet for a smooth exit.",2012-03-20 00:55:03

I came here based on reviews while wandering downtown after getting out of business trip obligations early, and it was a perfect place for a solo dinner with a couple beers.

The interior is cool, a modern take on a classic bistro look with the same posters and warm ambiance but high ceilings, couch seating at some tables, and cool lighting. Of note: a sweet chef's counter you can sit at in the back that overlooks the kitchen.

Great selection of local brews and cool upscale food, all with suggested beer pairings, or beer in the food! I had a ""devil's puttanesca"" mussel bowl - think mussels made with pasta puttanesca ingredients with a pale ale instead of a white wine. Seriously good mussels, and seriously great broth with extra bread to soak it up delivered upon request. Sweet.

So definitely good for solo dining, and I could certainly see myself here with a smallish group also. Solid work, Beer Bistro.",2009-08-10 03:42:24
482,804,,"This is a 2 star only because my wife's meal was edible and the manager took care of my meal issues.  We went to lunch expecting a nice meal.  We have been to this location at least 30 times over the years and have had good meals.  Today not the case.  Start with the edible meal.  My wife ordered chicken tortilla soup and turkey sandwich with small salad.   The bowl of CHICKEN tortilla soup had 2, maybe 3 pieces of actual chicken in it.  Hardly any tortilla in the soup, but it had flavor and was spicy.  We were given white sourdough bread, but expected the good dark sweet bread that we have received every other time here.  For some reason we didn't get the bread we liked but the tables next to us got it?   Her sandwich was okay, nothing to brag about.  I ordered a dinner portion Cobb salad.  I have ordered this before and really enjoyed it.  This time it came out looking sad.  I noticed a literal ball shape of chicken on the right side of the salad.  Upon inspecting it and peeling apart the chicken layers, it was nasty.  It showed many signs of being undercooked, was a bit slippery, and was fatty.  It was also stone cold.  It looked like someone reached into an old tray of chicken and grabbed a ball of old chicken and set it on my salad.  The kitchen staff obviously did not inspect the chicken.  The rest of the salad was not too good.  Hardly any egg around the edge like I normally get.  Barely any dressing in the salad and not much bacon.  It was basically chopped lettuce.   I showed the waitress the chicken and her face showed it all.  She showed the manager and he came over and apologized and agreed that the chicken looked bad.  He did not charge me for the salad.  I was offered replacement food as well but did not feel like eating anything else there at the time.   The salad was $15.  I hope they have not changed their salads since the last time I had a good one there.   It definitely was not worth $15 even with a good piece of chicken.  

Overall, a nice day off with my wife and the lunch was a huge disappointment.  I probably won't go back to this restaurant for a while.  The staff were nice and I left a 15% tip based on the full meal price before the comped salad.  Not the waitress fault that the kitchen was inept today in performing their job.",2016-12-14 04:17:07

860,1172,,"StripSteak is the ultimate in artery clogging indulgence.    Dry aged steaks, poached in clarified butter and cooked on wood fired grills.  Yes, I said poached in butter.  The steak is first heated in warm BUTTER before it is grilled.   This process results in the richest, most tender, most flavorful steak I have ever had.  I'm sure the cut of steak we chose also helped, we both had the ribeye cap.  The cap is the ultra rich and soft outside layer of the ribeye.  The part that I normally save for last because I like it so much.  This is the only place I've ever heard of that serves just the cap.  It was amazing!   

We also had the foie gras sliders, the foie was great, but I thought that the other accoutrements took away from its flavor.  The duck fat fries were delicious, especially the truffled ones.  The mac and cheese was great, super rich with plenty of truffle oil.   

As if all this wasn't enough, we topped it off with warm beignets topped with creme brulee, a fittingly rich and delicious dessert.

777,24,,"Heard so much about Las Vegas buffets and were excited to finally try it. However, we were utterly disappointed by Bellagio's lunch buffet. It's hotel buffet, only with more options, at premium price, but not premium food selections or quality. 

Service: indifferent and slow. I had to stack up my plates real high so that they can see it, and would then bother to come over to take it away. This was the case even before the restaurant got busy.

Environment: Clean and spacious. Dim yellow lights are not my favorite ambience, looks tired and aged. Flies flying around, should I expect little friends? 

Presentation: the food looks tired, poorly presented/cut. Look at my photos and decide for yourself, does the food look appetizing?

Food: Uninspired food that are not even up to the standard of food court food. The cooked fish were overcooked and under seasoned. The pizza fillings were generous, but it was average pizza. The sushi were the cheapest quality sushi you can find, no salmon or avocado in it, just vegetables, com'on!! Steak... where's the steak!? In my books, no steak = no buffet, especially premium priced buffets!! Stir fry vegetables, Panda Panda does better, in both taste, presentation, selection and quality!  Egg Benedict, this is my favorite, good hollandaise sauce and runny yolk, yum! But for this to be a highlight is pretty sad.

Dessert: Decent, but nothing exciting and poorly presented. Each slice was cut haphazardly in uneven sizes and rough edges. Sincerely, the food courts does better, at a tenth of the price! 

Price and low down: $28.99 for weekday lunch. If you are eating alone, sure, a buffet here may be worthwhile as you can eat more selections of food. However, I would still recommend to go elsewhere for better value for money. If you are eating as a group, I definitely recommend going to eat at different restaurants, even for take outs. It's better to eat food that is prepared, cooked and presented with care, precision and heart. Bellagio's buffet is quantity without quality.",2017-08-20 03:37:03

601,333,,"Watching a Thunder from Down Under show for the first time feels like an initiation.  Like discovering a secret place where it's socially acceptable for everyday women to completely lose their minds.

I was planning on staying coherent enough to write an anthropological study on this phenomenon, but it was too powerful even for me.  Before I knew it, I, too, was screaming giddily and spilling my vodka cranberry on the poor lady next to me.

In my addled state of mind, I couldn't tell you too many details about the show itself.  It's basically a mix of acts.  Group dances, one-person dances, bits where the host calls people on stage.  The dances usually end with a random audience member chosen and brought up on stage for some very classy second-base fondling.  The music and costumes are gloriously cheesy (""Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy,"" natch).  The performers don't stick to the stage, so don't be surprised if a sweaty buff man in kneepads jumps up onto your table and gyrates his speedo in your face.  I mean, maybe that doesn't surprise you anyway, but just a heads-up.

Though I didn't find the show particularly titillating, the big emotional impact came from being surrounded by a vortex of screaming women and from being in close proximity to really hot, shirtless guys.  There was also the mixture of abject horror and fascination that came with watching a grandmother who looked like Mrs. Doubtfire eagerly reaching into a guy's leather pants and stroking him.  I don't know about you, but that's not something I get to see every day.  

If you go with a group of your spunkiest friends, the fun increases exponentially.  I recommend that you get liquored up beforehand, as the drinks in the theater are overpriced and a bit slow in coming (like your mum).     

There's no stuffing of cash into G-strings, but the performers take photos after the show for $20 (cash).  You should do this, because you are creepy like me. 

The shirtless guy taking my money: What's your name?  
Me: Rebecca.
Shirtless guy: Oh.  That's Bicky.  We'd call you Bicky in Australia.
Me: Yes.  Yes, sir.
Shirtless guy: (leading me to the sofa) Everyone, this is Bicky.

Then followed an odd moment when I realized just how incredibly sweaty these men get.  They pulled me down on their laps (I swear) and they were soaked.  I almost slid off.  There were towels piled under the sofa.  Luckily I know the butterfly stroke and was able to get out of there.  

P.S.  The current performers are a lot better-looking than the ones on the posters and promotional materials, some of which look to be from 1998.  Don't worry, ladies.  The new ones look nothing like the curly-haired guy from Color Me Badd.",2013-08-07 17:03:39

My husband got on a booking app & booked us an appointment at 3:00pm right away. We walked up to the door at exactly 3:01 & the door was locked. Another couple was sitting outside & said it was closed & they were waiting to get in also. At 3:05 we checked the door again & it was unlocked but no one came outside to tell us they had unlocked the door! (Weird...they saw us trying the door handle). The man who sat us at our table  argued with us about how they were booked!

To our waiters credit he was good but he was the only one running around & since they were ""booked"" until 9pm I would think they would have others waiters? After a long 2 hours the place NEVER filled up! There were probably 150 empty seats!! So I'm not sure why they made such a big deal out of them being booked up?!! 

The food was good but over priced for what you got. The scallops were good but the price comes out to about $10 a piece. The chopped salad everyone made a big deal of was not that big in portion. It was good but for $14 I'll pass.

I ordered a vodka/tonic & it was as flat as a pancake!

We didn't care for the atmosphere as it smells like an old moldy building.

The first time I visited Gold and Silver, Pawn Stars was relatively new and we thought it would be fun to check it out. It was like a typical Pawn Shop save for a few ""Pawn Stars"" t-shirts.

The second time I visited Gold and Silver, Pawn Stars was becoming extremely popular. The place was going through a renovation and my mother and I brought in some scrap metals to sell at market price. The man we met with was kind and courteous and even gave us a signed photo of Rick Harrison and The Old Man. Overall it was a pleasant experience.

On out last trip however we decided to visit the shop again since the show is now the #1 show on cable. What we encountered was an extremely rude staff and absolutely no courtesy as potential buyers. The man behind the counter was extremely rude to my mother and in my book, that's not acceptable.

1637,641,,"Had a lovely 2 night, 3 day stay at Vdara. I've been curious about it, and the City Center in general, even though I love both my mainstays, The Delano and The Bellagio. I may have a new favorite, however, at least if I can always get the corner suite upgrade!

The lobby is smaller than the usual Strip hotel, given it has no casino. But it is a very nice place to hang out, with a great bar/lounge area, an outside patio and a few other places to hang out. Check-in was a breeze and everyone, from Valet to Bellman to the person behind the front desk, were wonderful. 

I was on a high floor, in a corner suite. I'd been offered the upgrade via email after I made a reservation. This ""room"" is incredible. Think of a big square with 4 quadrants... kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom. There is a long windowed hallway from the door leading into the square.

As it is a corner room there are windows everywhere! I was on the backside... the other side must be incredible, looking directly onto the Strip. But this was wonderful as well, as I could still see most of the hotels at various places, and I could see the Bellagio fountains from the bathroom. And the sunset each evening was stunning. 

The bed was incredibly comfy and the bathroom huge and inviting. I used the kitchen each morning for breakfast. You have to call down for everything but they brought up pots and pans and plates quickly. I agree with others that paying for the Keurig is silly. I brought a small coffee maker of my own. 

All told, it was an almost perfect experience and I will stay here again and again. (I come to Vegas at least twice a year, usually.) Given there is no casino, it is not as 'happening' as other hotels, but for many this is a great perk. And the Aria is a two minute walk away, maximum, and the Cosmo close as well. 

My one 'complaint' was with the Valet. NOT the people who work there. These men and women were working hard, seriously. They simply did not seem to have enough people, so it took forever to get your car. And for some odd reason, unlike every other hotel I've been to, they won't let you call ahead for the car. You have to go down there and stand in line to give them your ticket, then you have a long wait for the car.

Otherwise, though, top notch all around and I can't wait to go back. I stayed in the room much more than usual on a Vegas trip... I did not want to leave!",2016-03-29 16:35:37

When my bf lived in Dallas we frequented that location and it was also phenomenal. My favorite burger, so flavorful, and the chili con queso fries are amazing!

The bad: This location is no where near as amazing as the others. My favorite thing is the chili con queso fries and the last few times I've been the dip hasn't been mixed up. There's huge chunks of meat or unmelted cheese. How hard is it to stir it? They also fill up the cup less than halfway full which is nowhere near enough. Especially when you're paying $7+ for it. I always order a plain and dry classic burger. For some reason the burgers are not as flavorful here as they are at the other locations and they always overcook it. I specifically tell them medium each time (rather than the standard medium to medium well) and it always ends up medium well to well done. You pay and tip before being seated, some days service is decent some days no one says one word to you. When we first started coming we would tip 20%, but now that we realize service doesn't really happen here we tip less. Plus you order at the register and get your own drinks/sauce etc. and napkins are on the table. So service needs are minimal. I really wish it was either sit-down service or full counter. I feel guilty not-tipping, but unless I'm sitting at the bar (where I do tip 20%+) they don't do much.  

Conclusion: This branch needs to step it up to be the quality of the other locations. Austin and Dallas are 5 star, Scottsdale is 4 on a good day but generally more of a 3.",2015-11-12 23:48:44

- came to Vegas for EDC but our group was staying for about a week in Vegas
- we were a group of 6 but wanted to be comfortable during our stay
- we booked a Bella Suite, which has 2 queen beds and a queen pull out bed - it was perfect for our needs 

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- pretty grandeur

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- huge (from the lobby, to the food court, to the casino, to the many different shops, to the room itself)
- the room was very spacious and the bathroom was too
- I liked how although there was bed room for 6 people, it felt separated (i.e. the 2 queen beds had their own space and their own TV; the queen pull out had its own space with the desk, a dining table of sorts, and its own TV)

CONS:
- no locks on the bathroom
- it would take a while for housekeeping services (i.e. to request more towels as ours got dirty)
- no fridge (there is a mini bar, but it's not like you can put your own drinks or personal food to keep cool in there)
- we had more than enough time to be out and about when we checked in but our bags took a very long time to get to us in our room

Some of the banquet hall staff members was just chilling with the bartender, talking, and one of the bald guys with glasses was actually downright offensive in his mannerisms, the way he was dealing with the guests. 
One of the older gentlemen in the party accidentally was about to walk behind the bar (he had a drink or two), and was stopped as soon as he was told by the bartender without any confrontation, but this overzealous staff member (they bald guy with the glasses) started chanting the Arizona statute for what happens when someone walks behind the bar like there was a crime in progress, and he wasn't even serving drinks, he was actually just chilling with the bartender, distracting him by just non nonchalantly talking.
My suggestion to anyone who's planning to organize a party here, spend some more money and go somewhere else, the staff here is downright unprofessional and rude.

We visited on a very chilly night and after a drink at the bar, my husband suggested we have our early dinner outside on the patio under all the heaters. I scoffed. It's really cold. The hostess suggested blankets. So she pulled out cozy blankets to cover our chilly laps! After sitting at our intimate table underneath the heaters, I really didn't need it and enjoyed the moonlit sky.

Our server was Andre and he was great! Attentive and friendly without being too chatty. My husband had the sea bass and I had the pork tenderloin. We also had the wedge salad. Sticky buns yummy as always! Our food was moist, delicious and perfectly cooked. Soooo happy!

The restaurant (on a Saturday night around 8ish) was brightly lit and chaotic with patrons.  The long lines meant a long wait, especially for adobada, which is much, much better than the carne asada, which is good but not great.  

The homemade tortillas are about the size of your palm.  A taco with everything comes with meat, onions, cilantro, lime, salsa and a smooth avocado sauce that wasn't exactly guacamole.  I also had a quesadilla, which is the same thing as a taco but with good white cheese stuck to the tortilla and a fried tortilla on top.  

Order your tacos first, then go pay at the cashier to get your cups for drinks.  There's a soda machine and an horchata machine, the kind with the happy face logo that says ""Ole!""

The fries with meat (carne asada, adobada, or a mixture of the two which is called campechana, I think) is a three-pound box filled with everything your cardiologist doesn't want you to eat.  Cheese, fries, crema, meat.  You can share this among four people and you will probably still not finish it.

Tacos are two dollars each.  A meal with a drink will be about $10-12 dollars, which is a lot for a taco joint.

However, the people watching is first-rate.  Besides Mexican families and the occasional adventurous Midwesterner, customers include hotel workers, drunken frat boys, and honest-to-goodness prostitutes.  At the table next to ours, there was a lively and profanity-spangled discussion in Spanish about the true definition of a chilango.  On the patio, a group of young men in their early-twenties with matching vests and threaded eyebrows fortified themselves before a night of what would no doubt be the liberal distribution of rohypnol.  All of these people and more you will find at the Las Vegas Strip Tacos El Gordo.  All united in taco solidarity.  This is a good place.",2013-04-16 20:56:17

1995,777,,"La Banquise aurait apparemment la réputation d'être le meilleur resto de poutine de Montréal. J'ai bien dit ""aurait apparemment"". Nous avons donc eu envie d'aller voir par nous même!  Malheureusement, ce fut encore un cas de ""réputation plus grande que nature"". 
Sur place, nous constatons que l'endroit est minuscule. Les tables et les chaises sont petites, et notre table était sale, il y avait encore de la sauce dessus. J'ai moi-même pris un napkin pour essayer la table! 

Cet endroit est très bien pour connaître les gens; mon voisin de table qui est un parfait étranger était à 10 cm de moi et je pouvais tout suivre de sa conversation avec son ami. 
Après quelques minutes, la serveuse vient prendre la commande; j'opte pour une petite poutine à la sauce poivrée. 
Le service est un peu long, mais les poutines arrivent finalement. 
Les frites ne semblent pas très fraîches et sont un peu mordantes sous la dent, pas très bien cuites. 
Le goût est bien, rien d'extraordinaire; j'ai connu des poutines meilleures ailleurs! 
Ne voulant pas nous arrêter sur une note négative, nous décidons d'essayer les desserts.
Ce ne fût pas vraiment un succès. Le pudding chômeur était sec et un peu granuleux sous la dent, et le gâteau triple chocolat goûtait un peu le congelé, on sentait parfaitement le goût de l'humidité de congélateur à chaque bouchée. 
Alors que nous attendions l'addition, nous remarquons que le sol est bien sale. 
Mais au moins la facture n'était pas très élevée, ca il faut bien leur donner! 

Bref, au risque de péter la balloune à certaines personnes, le resto La Banquise n'est pas LE resto de poutine à Montréal pour les connaisseurs de poutine :)",2013-04-10 00:50:25

Or it could probably be that I didn't order their signature Rosemary steak.. I ordered Pollo (chicken) sandwich and it was very average . The red sauce was good but one of the sauce was terrible.. I really loved the cookie and infact bought a few more to go as well. Will try their steak next time to be fair .. But for whatever I ate today I will give only 4..,2016-01-20 02:54:09

If that's what you're looking for then this is your restaurant, but if you're wanting something that isn't smothered in cheese to hide dull Italian food then look elsewhere.

Service is lacking to say the least and wait times even when slow can be way too long.  45-50 mins for thin pizza!?  

My wife is gluten free and her pie was very lacking.  She compared it to having cheese and sauce melted onto a chip.  

Brixx makes arguably a better pizza and is definitely more reasonable at $8-$10.  They make a very good gluten free pizza as well.  Also you are eating your Brixx pizza within 15-20 mins max.

951,517,,"Very mediocre sushi. I can find better quality at my local Wholefoods in LA... Came here for a quick bite and the restaurant was fairly packed for a Friday. My husband and I were seated right away around 9:20pm at the bar. We weren't hungry enough to do all you can eat so opted for a la carte, and thank God for that.  After the first few orders I was over it and wanted to leave.
We ordered:
Miso soup-came out cold, not even warm
Scallop sushi-not fresh
garlic tuna sushi-bad quality tuna drowned in ponzu sauce 
seaweed salad-didn't taste fresh so didn't finish it
yellow tail collar-came out last when we order it first. 1 star for the collar because how can you go wrong with fried fish
Palm job handroll- lol $12 not worth it!!! We couldn't order it half size. It was basically soy paper with imitation crab meat drowned in spicy mayo and other sauces) 

Service is so slow. Sushi men aren't even Japanese and we're talking in Spanish amongst each other. Worst bar sitting experience. We love talking/drinking with the sushi men which is why we always sit at the bar. Not coming back. Do not waste your time and Money",2017-05-13 04:58:34

82,827,,"This is a great, unique, original place.  My family loves it.

The truth is, if you read the reviews, they are all spot on in one way or another.  Yes, its cash only.....   yes, they make you stand in a second line to buy drinks, and salad, and ice cream.  yes, the pizza is not drawing Oprah Winfrey to it to declare it the best pizza in America.  

BUT....

This is the most unique thing you will ever see.  The food is good enough, and priced about what you would expect.  In fact, I think the quality has actually gone up over the years, but pizza is like coffee - snobs abound speculating what makes a pizza great.  At the end of the day, this pizza is pretty good for the family.  No one complains, everyone eats full amounts.

But unlike other ""unique"" places that are ""unique"" because they have funny pictures of people urinating in the bathroom, or kayaks on the walls or whatever, this actually has an oddly unique entertainment concept.  

We have tried it several ways, and do note, if you have not been, there is a method to the madness - if you swim with the fish, its far easier than swimming against the school.  What I mean by that is this:

The place gets PACKED.  When it opens there is a HUGE amount of people outside.  But their business goes in waves.  All the people crowd in, and order pizza at the same time, get drinks at the same time, sit at the same time, and for all practical purposes, leave at the same time.

The first ""Set"" is all old folks and families with tiny kids.  If you go with this crowd, get there 15 mins before it opens and don't freak when you are in a big line - you will get the seats you want.  

But, the interesting thing, is that if you go later in the evening, at the end of each set, a large group of people will leave all at once.  This ends up being the best time to go, because there are no lines, and you get great seats.   It's inevitable, if its packed, wait 3o minutes and half the crowd will leave, all at once!  

The organ itself is massive, and the instruments littered all over the roof, walls and back of the restaurant are controlled in time with the music.  In many cases, you can't really figure out which pipes are playing, but ""big"" songs like ITS A SMALL WORLD, and STAR WARS seem to use every instrument and its amazing.  Kids love it, old folks love it, everyone loves it.  (fair warning, I was one of those people that grew up with this place as a kid, in the 1970's.....  LOTS of great memories here, and my kids get the same experience that I had back then - it hasn't changed that much).  

Later in the evening, things like the Canadian Flag descend and the Canada anthem plays, with lots of people getting up and singing and crying, followed by the Star Spangled Banner and Old Glory, Followed by Mickey Mouse Club flag, etc.  This is the kind of place, that you better stand and put your hand over your heart or you WILL get a WW2 Vet punching your jaw.

We bring all sorts of family and visitors here.  Do we bring them to show them that we have found the worlds best Pizza?  No.  A great Micro Brew selection?  oh no....  The best music you ever heard?  No (things played on an organ sound different).  But we take them here because when you add up all the small parts, its the most unique thing you have ever witnessed.  It comes off as one of those little niche concepts that some crazy inventor came up with that may work no where else but on this street corner.

Believe it, people come here to celebrate 50 yr wedding anniversaries and stuff - they read them out loud and its amazing.  This place, with all its random uniqueness is part of the culture of Phoenix and Arizona - which, is why it lands on lists for good dating experiences, etc.  If you propose to your future wife here, yes, you have no taste, but bring your kids here?  Then you are a cool dad! :-)",2014-08-10 05:52:41
1451,994,,The taste went down or they were just having a bad day. Their butter chicken and chicken tikka looked the same and tasted same ?? I would really tell them to figure out the taste because prices are a bit high for the quality I got last time.,2017-11-17 14:52:07
256,1045,,"$32.99 for a Thursday dinner. One glass of wine included pp (cab, chardonney, or merlot). $1 off pp if you use your TR card. One TR card can give you that discount for up to 5 ppl the TR staff told me.

Wine was good; it didn't give me a headache like most red wines do.

The food is overall more dressed up American food than French. About 20% of the selection looked to be traditional French dishes.

Service is quick about taking your plates away but slow to refill your water, get you a beverage, or clean an empty table. Service also seemed overwhelmed/annoyed if you asked for things. I asked one staff member for water and in response, she silently pointed at the server I should be asking. I was turned off by that and would have liked her to provide a more polite response.

What is bizarre is that there is a line to get in that winds around twice in front of the buffet, but if you go inside, there are consistently about 20+ tables that are empty in the back section of the dining area. Why did we wait in line for about 20+ minutes to get seated when there were so many empty tables near the serving area?

They make crepes right in front of you. It was good. Would have loved to finish mine except I was beyond full.

The best dishes there were the pork and apples skillet and the seafood bouillabaisse. There is also a carving station for prime rib.

In the dessert section, there is a variety of cookies, eclairs, cookies, ice cream, flan, creme brulee, macarons, and fresh fruit. The basket of pears was full of rotting pears. The flan was good; not the jell-o kind.

1584,389,,"When the weather is nice, Joe's Farm Grill is a great place to enjoy a casual picnic dinner under the shade of some enormous salt cedar trees.  At Joe's you place your order inside a vintage 1960s farmstead building.  Don't let the line deter you - it will give you time to study the menu and read about the history of the farm.  After you've ordered, they'll give you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready.  

I went with a group, which gave me an opportunity to sample several of the house specialties.  My favorite was the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwich with strawberries, pineapple and chocolate chips.  It sounded bizarre enough that none of us wanted to take a chance on ordering it, so we agreed to get one to split.  It was so amazing - with crispy toast and bursting with fruit and nut flavors - that I instantly regretted not ordering a whole one for myself.  If you try one, I recommend substituting some crispy sweet potato fries for the regular ones that come with it.  These fries are served with a delicious pineapple and jalapeno relish.

For my main dish I got the fontina burger.  The pecan pesto nicely complemented the fontina cheese and grilled mushrooms, and the burger came with a generous stack of garnishes like lettuce and tomato.  With this one I'd substitute in the garlic fries - I could sit down and eat a whole dish of these scrumptiously seasoned beauties for dinner.   The only thing Joe's could use is a craft beer list, but you'll need to settle for soft drinks because no alcohol is served here.",2015-05-16 01:10:13

The stark contrast between daylight and the darkness in Herbs & Rye temporarily hurts the eyes and causes you to see total darkness for a few seconds after the door shuts quietly behind you, escorting you into a lush experience as your eyes adjust to the light levels and you see the colorful yet subdued sprawling bar and restaurant. Dark woods, candlelight, think old Vegas, where the locals might hang out. Or those who go for a menu that is more drink than meal. Definitely more substance than fluff.

Happy hour is from 5-8 pm (and I think 12-3 am) with half off most cuts of beef and 50% off house wines and a few other things. 

The house wine (Dark Horse) was very good for a by-the-glass reasonable option and I had two glasses. My husband had a glass of champagne and thought it a bit sweet - he would have ordered more had there been a larger selection and a definitive brut.

My husband loved his steak, the 18 oz ribeye. It was so big he took half of it to go and it was done so perfectly that he was able to reheat it and it was still mildly medium rare the next day for lunch. Touche!

Normally when this happens in a decent restaurant the manager comes over or there's some sort of apology.   At Lazy Dog the waitress acted like it wasn't a bid deal and didn't offer an apology or anything. We had to wait an additional 20 minutes for my son to get his food, not fun for a 4 year old.

1734,598,,Food is great! Nice variety to the menu and food came out in a timely manner. ( I ordered a lot of food.) Definitely check it out if you are a fan of Italian food. Overall,2017-04-22 15:33:24
875,527,,"This breakfast/brunch joint is the hidden gem you hope to find when you want to escape from the generic boring IHOP'S and Dennys' of the world. I love restaurants that get creative with their menus! This place gives you plenty of options and offers a unique variety that will leave you so indecisive, you have to come back again to try something else! They also have daily specials that aren't on the regular menu and they are just as tempting when you aren't sure what you're in the mood for. 
I tried the fried bologna sandwich because it is something I've never had in my life. It was good, the sandwich was big, the grilled onions give it extra flavor and there's plenty of meat.  I don't know if I'd order it again, only because I'm not used to eating bologna when it's hot and it's not something I'd eat often, but there were plenty of other things I want to try in the future. 
I chose potato salad to go with my sandwich,  the tricky thing about potato salad is if you're making it while the potatoes are still hot,  you're going to get a funky taste once you add the dressing to it. It was okay,  but it was even better when I added California 3 pepper hot sauce to it. That hot sauce is magical! I'm going to buy a bottle or 2 when I go back. I wish I could buy a case, I have a feeling they will make an excellent sauce for hot wings!  They sell the bottles up in the front and there are 3 different kinds to choose from. They also have baked goods, I didn't try them yet,  but they looked good- nice and big in size. Prices are fair and comparable to other breakfast places, but I can tell you the flavor and quality rises waaay above the generic ""blah"" of soggy undercooked hash browns from the likes of Denny's. The waitress and manager were friendly and welcoming.

16,15,,"The decor and everything int he restaurant is really nice and sheik looking. We got the Resting Panda and the Whiskey sour, both of which were very tasting drinks. We started with the Foo Foo plater (just to be able to try a bit of everything). It was pretty good actually, I'd highly recommend it! Our server (i believe her name was Nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful. She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice. I'd give this place one more try...But I most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again.",2015-01-03 22:17:56
971,236,,"*this review is based on service experience,  not food. 

Dear Morris Ramen,

I came to you on the afternoon of 9/8/17 with a slip of paper that held my full name, card number, and expiration date. Knowing you do not take reservations, after speaking with the host, I explained and wrote down the 3 customers who would be coming in at 7pm and that I would like to pay for their first round of drinks. (Written on paper with bank and customer info given to host.)

I arrive at 7pm with said guests. Table is sat, I order a round of sake. I am short on time and have to leave my guests before they are done eating. While still at the table, a server quickly drops off the slip of paper which I gave to the host earlier in the day with my card info on it. I ask the busied server ""is this taken care of?"" She says ""yes"".  
Later I receive a text from my friend that she had to pay for the sake I promised to have earlier taken care of. My friend says to me ""they said they don't do that"". 

It has been 30 minutes past with me calling your business number to discuss this matter and to offer my guests dessert as well as a fixed payment, and unfortunately, no answer. 

I am very dissatisfied with this. I stated clearly to the host with my name and phone number as well card info to apply to the check and to give me a call if there was any problems. I was later identified as this person and no action was taken. It was not only embarrassing but unprofessional.",2017-09-09 01:26:19
1974,995,,"I was visiting for work and our hotel recommended dinner at this restaurant, great recommendation! 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is trendy, modern, very low lighting restaurant. They are known for their 60 second steak which is cooked on one side. Unfortunately I wasn't craving steak, I know its a crime! Instead I got the seared sea scallops with a side order of spinach. The way the sweet potatoes were done blew my mind away as they were mashed and so tasty. The amount of food was perfect where you didn't feel like a fatty after licking your plate clean. 

I was so full from dinner I didn't have a chance to try out their dessert so the next time I'm in Charlotte I will need to stop by for that!",2015-11-10 01:55:55

Love the outdoor seating and the drinks were great. They poured hefty servings of Glenlivet 12 and their Crescent Crush house cocktail - their take on a Greyhound - and served in a pint glass was dangerously delicious. 

The ballroom was perfect - small and loud. 

Definitely coming back.",2013-04-10 19:55:47
1228,1186,,"We were lucky to come across this new restaurant that just opened a month ago on our trip to Vegas this past February. Both the bf and his sister are fans of David Chang and to our surprise, we were actually able to see him that night while dining there. Apparently there was a Yelp Elite Event that I had NO IDEA about or else I would have signed up!! Seeing David Chang totally made their night, even if was just for a second before the servers closed up the blinds and obstructed their view haha. 
 
We had made reservations for dinner, without knowing that their hours were updated to include lunch as well. Too bad...Momofuku had some pretty interesting stuff on the lunch menu, but we were impressed by dinner nonetheless. Their menu is updated DAILY - which is crazy to me. We ordered a variety of things and decided to do family style and share so we could try out a little of everything.   

PORK BELLY BUNS (2 per order) $14 - hoisin, scallion, cucumber. These were kind of pricey at $7 each for a tiny bun, but we wanted to get them cause of the popularity. I've had better buns and they were nothing special. It was alright for an appetizer. If I were to return - would definitely pass on it. 

MOMOFUKU OYSTERS $28 - broiled with kimchi, spinach, bacon. MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT. 10 total oysters and I probably ate more than half myself. They were SOOOO good. Just the right amount of spicy and crunchy from the kimchi and bacon. I secretly wanted to have the whole plate of oysters to myself. Add in a bowl of rice to make a complete meal and I would have been in heaven.  

SPICY SICHUAN RICE CAKES $21 - pork sausage, broccoli, crispy onions. At first, I was really excited to try them because I usually like spicy food. However... took one bite and my mouth/tongue felt like it was on fire and burning. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to fully enjoy the rice cakes, but my other 2 tablemates loved this dish very much. Glad that they were able to handle the spicyness and finish the plate themselves! This was my least favorite...due to my weak taste buds and/or the strong Sichuan sauce.

SWEET & SOUR LONG BEANS $8. Just like the name itself, this dish was super simple but to our surprise, it was delicious. We needed some type of veggie dish with our dinner to make it seem like it we were eating somewhat healthy lol. The long beans did not taste at all that bad like green vegetables usually do. In fact, whatever sweet & sour sauce they coated the beans in had such great flavor that it made me forget I was even eating beans. SECOND FAVORITE of the night. 

STEAMED RICE $4. I'm Chinese and we need rice with every meal daily, so you know I had to order a bowl. 

CRACK PIE $6.50 - oat crust with a gooey butter filling. We were planning to go to Milk Bar afterwards, but decided to just get dessert at Momofuku. Everyone raved about the crack pie, so obviously we had to get it. It's a small slice that's packed with ooey, gooey goodness. I loved the toasted crust and the filling inside was amazing.   

Knowing that it's Vegas, you're kind of expected to pay a premium for everything. Momofuku had some hit and misses with the food for me... but overall, I did enjoy everything. I also liked the service and ambiance of the restaurant. Side note, I went into the women's restrooms and they have heated toilets!! It amazed me so much that I spent some time in there trying it out lol... anyway I did have a wonderful time with good company and now I can say that I was able to dine at a David Chang restaurant.",2017-03-19 07:38:15
729,56,,"I've been in Phoenix for about 3 weeks now (relocating from So Cal) and have been very disappointed in the Mexican Restaurants thus far. A friend of mine suggested Carolina's. It's only 3 miles from my office so I gave it a shot for lunch. GLAD I DID! 

I went with my wife and a colleague who both verified my evaluation! We all 3 ordered different things. I'll speak for my chimichanga.... Lightly fried and full of white chicken meat. I also ordered some chips and salsa (extra) which seemed fresh as can be. I ordered 6 corn tortillas to go because i heard they were so good (made fresh daily). I had to try one (they were still warm). Delicious! 

Not the best Mexican food I've ever had but by far the best Mexican food thus far in Phoenix. You order and pay at the counter and your number is called within minutes. Fair prices, too. This place will be in my regular rotation for lunches going forward!",2011-08-23 03:43:20

604,1223,,"Amazing food, great service, good beer and a great atmosphere.  Look for the Volkswagon Beetle on the roof.

Rumor has it that this place is run by the people that ran The Penguin (a Charlotte institution) for decades.  They've split with ownership and opened Pinky's.  It has the same vibe and great food at inexpensive prices.  I haven't confirmed all of this, but it's generally accepted as fact in Charlotte...maybe its just an urban legend.

I had the Ding Dong chicken sandwich, which is slaw, sirachi, and crunchy peanut butter. I was suspicious of this combo at first, but am now a believer.  I didn't expect it (maybe I'm just slow), but the combination tasted Thai inspired, almost like pad thai.  I also had the sweet potato fries, also good.  

Definitely will be going back to check out the rest of the menu.",2012-08-01 11:51:37

It was dark, dank, crowded & tight, hard to read complicated menus (plastered on old record covers; a cute idea, but I couldn't read the small print in the dimly lit room) bring a magnifying glass... noisy, expensive, tight crowded seating, poor service-took forever to get my sandwich, sorry but it shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a grilled cheese sandwich. Hard to eat thick slices of bread - how the heck can you get a 3 inch tall sandwich in your mouth. The bread slices are an inch thick, slathered with butter or oil (not sure what they use) a small amount of filling in comparison. Basically an artery clogging heart attack on a plate! Served with cold fries, My sandwich was all wet from the pickle juice it was sitting in from the garnish pickle slice ""INEDIBLE""

The decor consists of hundreds of Halloween & Christmas light-up lawn ornaments lit up with strings of twinkle lights here and there (cute two times a year, but I don't want to see snowman, rabbits, pumpkins and Santa while having dinner lining the walls.  If you don't mind all this and are willing to spend an average of $14.50 for a greasy grilled cheese sandwich, then go. Otherwise you have been warned.",2015-04-29 20:16:28

Prices are decent especially for Vegas and the food is delicious.  I have never had something I didn't like.  My favorite was the brunch tapas menu.  For a set price (I think it was $20 for brunch plus $5 for mimosas) you get unlimited tapas and mimosas.  The tapas menu had about 20 items on it and everyone I had was amazing.  I was so full I had to stop.  The plantain empanada, mini burito, and Machaca Chilaquiles were particularly amazing.  My mouth is watering thinking about them.  

The service was also amazing.  We had a group of 10 and it was very fast even with the large group.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating.

The rest of the food was pretty good. Unfortunately this place is way over-priced. We were charged $8 just to have our bottle of wine opened. The menu stated that the charge for opening the wine was $2.50 per person (and up) and there was only the two of us.

The dark lighting makes it hard to read the menus but good thing they have flashlights inside. Definitely try the salad with the garlic dressing it is so delicious. I got the arrabiata pasta and added a meatball and was so disappointed our hotel didn't have a fridge because I would have loved to eat the left overs. This is a great place to go for a date or as a group. Even though it is a little off the strip it is totally worth it for the great experience.

I first found out about this company when I was living in SF and a small chocolate shop was carrying them. I honestly could not get enough of them. My first bar I had and still my favorite bar is the Goji Bar and Sea Salt. It is truly the perfect balance of salty and sweet. 

The shop when you first walk in is quite overwhelming at all the different kinds of varieties that they have. Every time I go it always seems like they are just adding more and more new/ amazing favor combos. The newest one I saw was candied carrot and chocolate and believe it or not it was pretty darn good. I have to say an over all crowd favorite is probably the chocolate and bacon bar.  No matter what you are into I believe you can find something interesting here. There's everything from curry, to sesame, burbon and peanut better. They also have some very select chocolate that is vegan.

For $75 each, we had access to AYCE for the duration of the game. 

Food included:
Unlimited poke bar (with all the extras)
Peel & eat prawns - Mexican white prawns, sambal cocktail sauce
Nachos - chicken, queso, tortilla chips, black beans, tomato salsa, guacamole, scallions
Pigs in a blanket (with house ketchup & mustard)
Wings - pickled cucumber & carrots, chili, cilantro, garlic, peanut sauce
Meatballs - Nana's pork gravy, whipped ricotta, parsley
Bobby's sliders - kobe beef, aged cheddar, grilled onions
Boardwalk fries - old bay, malt vinegar aioli, ketchup, herbs
Mexican street corn - chipotle aioli, scallions, cotija, cilantro

Boyfriend really wanted to see the game and eat, so I went along with his choice of restaurant and the menu had food I was fine with. There was no wait as we walked in and got seated. The atmosphere was loud with tons of guys chattering and drinking. Dozens of flat screen tvs were all over the walls. I guess Vegas has these AYCE buffets specifically during the big game cause it makes the whole event really fun/exciting. There was a deal for drinks going on and since my bf ordered one - he got put into some lottery and the hostesses kept giving him free Jack Daniels stuff lol that was cool I guess. He got some stickers, lip balm, and a necklace.

I liked the idea of the poke bar, and there were tortilla chips too! They had the raw seafood all laid out in the back of the restaurant. The tako (octopus) tasted a lil better than the poke (fish). Poke was mushy and soft - like it wasn't fresh or it was just sitting/marinating in sauce for too long. The shrimps were awesome though. Good size, crunchy, and tasted great dipped with ketchup. I also enjoyed the tomatoes and cucumbers - definitely helped to clear that fishy taste in my mouth in preparation for the rest of food on the menu. 

I did not care for the corn, fries, nor the wings. The corn was covered in a lot of stuff and had waaay too much going on. Expected it to have tons of flavor but it just tasted dry with NO taste. Fries were okay. The wings were too spicy for me. My boyfriend liked the wings the most, and he also ended up eating the rest of the food. 

My favorites were the pigs in a blanket and the sliders for sure. I think I was so hungry that I just really craved meat at the moment and all the other appetizers were not cutting it for me. Pigs in a blanket was nothing special...but it was filling. That's all I wanted. Tasted like regular mini hotdogs with ketchup and mustard. The sliders were AMAZING. Don't know what sauce the patty was covered in, but it was delicious. Wanted to eat more sliders but I couldn't..was too stuffed from just one. #smallstomachproblems 

Wish we didn't order the nachos cause I wasn't expecting them to come in a large bowl. Honestly we just wanted to try a little bit of everything and went crazy ordering. Couldn't finish that along with the meatballs. The meatballs were gooOod, and we ended up taking that and the wings back to the hotel. The nachos were different and not to our liking. They didn't use regular melted cheddar cheese and the chicken was cold while everything else was kind of warm? It just didn't mix well together. I enjoyed a couple first bites of the nachos, but then I got tired of the taste later. 

If we were more hungry, I think the AYCE deal would have been worth it. But my boyfriend and I agreed that for what we paid, we did not get our money's worth. That always seems like the case for these types of situations regarding buffets/AYCE. We just came for the convenience, fast service and the game.... not for the price or food. Probably should have came to Herringbone for their regular breakfast/lunch/dinner hours and maybe then we'd feel like we actually got what we paid for.",2017-02-27 06:22:55
2237,1157,,"An overview of the food we ordered:

Ham wrapped cheese sticks - fantastic
Caprese salad - nothing special, pretty regular
Arugula salad - very good
Sonny pizza (salami and olives) - delicious - thin crust and the right ratio of sauce to toppings
Flourless chocolate cake - also delicious but I wish it would have come with ice cream and not this weird melted cream thing on the side.

This place was packed,  which is always a restaurant's greatest recommendation. Nice decor, very clean, and reasonable prices. Two of us with all that food got out of there for about 60 bucks.

I would definitely come back.",2014-10-26 06:19:47

I ordered the lobster wellington and she got the beef wellington.  Both were nice.

I arrived and asked the person who greeted me if they accept competitors coupons and was told yes they did.  After waiting about 10 minutes for a service rep I was told by this service rep that they don't accept competitors coupons and that it would be $12 more than what the competitor would have charged. Midway chevy does accept competitors coupons without any question. It isn't like I was using the $12 coupon from Big O tires. It was from a local Chevrolet dealership.  She asked who told me and then asked the kid who did and told him he was wrong and shouldn't be saying it. If I had known I would have either gone someplace else or gone back to midway Chevy. Be warned.. They will tell you yes until it comes time for them to take the car,  then tell you know and charge you more.

If you are used to Americanized pizza, you will not like this place which is probably what a lot of the recent reviwers are having issues with.  You aren't getting doughy pizza drowned with thick tomato sauces and lots of poor quality cheeses and toppings.   I read about this place in Men's Health Magazine as the best Pizza in America.  My brother was living in Phoenix and graduated from ASU so we were there in May and I made reservations way in advance to ensure we got a table.  Wait was less than 15 minutes with the reservation.  If you plan ahead, you don't have to wait 2+ hours.  The place is really small but love the look and feel of it.  I had the Biancoverde pizza which truly is the best pizza I've ever had and I didn't think anything could top the pizzas I tried in New York from some of the mom and pop shops there.  These are fire oven pizzas so they are not going to have oil soaked crusts and will be drier, and the fact that this joint makes their mozzerlla fresh is impressive and it's OH-mazing!  My wife had the Margherita pizza which was also out of this world and my parents who travel to Italy often said it's exactly like what they have had there.  The capri salad is also fabulous and so is the olive oil they bring out at the beginning you can dip the bread in.

There's only 10 tables or more inside so the wait can be very long.  Don't think you can go to dinner and then do something after unless it's really late.  You can never predict the line.  Also, once you get seated, dinner takes a while.  But if you make this your ""event"" for the night, enjoy the wait with come cocktails and maybe an app from the bar, you will love the food and experience.

We walk in and it is an astonishing view. Our room on the 50th floor faces the golf course and the beautiful waterfall behind it. The room is stunning with floor to ceiling windows and decorative mirrors. The shades are drawn by buttons in the middle console next to the beds. Not only are there 2 queen beds, there are two sinks and a vanity. There's a LCD in the bathroom, plasma in the main room and the alarm clock is an iHome iPod player that can charge our iPhones with.

Downstairs there are several late dining facilities and stores that open till midnight and serve drinks like mimosas and sparkling wine while you peruse the products. I get giddy just thinking about how nice it was. 

The staff and promoters here were also very helpful. Being guests there we had instant access to the club, which opens up onto their outdoor waterfall. While the music was subpar which I find with many Vegas clubs the view was fabulous and the drinks were good.

FOOD:
Al Pastor Taco (Station #4) - Delicious!  good pork favor and the toppings made it just right

Al Pastor Vampiro (Station #2) - Really good however i didnt even know what a Vampiro was.. there was no signs to describe it and no one could tell me what it was.  Vampiro is pretty much of a sandwich made of 2 hard corn tortilla, cheese, meat selection, onions, and salsa.   

Lengua Taco (Station #3) - meh, it was okay.  The tongue lacked favored and need to have that seared crispy to make it really good. 

SERVICE: 
The layout of the open kitchen, signs, and where the food trays are is kind of deceptive.  When you walk in it seems similar to Chipotle/Subway, where you start at one end and make your way down to the cashier. 

There are actually 5 lines (Nachos/Burrito line, Station #2 Line, Station #3 Line, Station #4 Line, and the Cashier ).  However the food trays are located only next to Station 4 which makes everyone form a huge line.  You stand in line for whichever type of food you want and than you go to the cashier to pay.  

The staff is polite and some are friendly the only problem is that no one explains what anything is... like a Vampiro vs. Mula vs. Tostada.  All the meats are listed and there are some you know off the bat just due to seeing it your whole life... but there are some i've never seen before.  When i ordered the Al Pastor Taco, the guy asked me if i wanted everything on it, I asked what is ""everything"" and he just looked at me.

Our 4yo had Mac and cheese + fresh berries. Extra good. My wife, mother-in-law, and I had the dip trio (the pesto made with spinach and the pequillo were delicious along with warm crispy flatbread)  to start.

Matt (our server) helped us make appropriate wine choices and never once pretended to know it all. He went for help when he didn't know everything about a wine and let us taste some wines before picking a favorite).

The wife's fish was excellent, the mil's pasta was homemade and delicious, and my pizza was warm. 

It took a bit before our food arrived.... Turns out that the fish was not cooked right so they let us know that they were remaking all of our meals to ensure freshness. We were fine with that. NOTE TO OTHER RESTAURANTS: acknowledge when something goes sideways and be honest about how you'll make up for it. Extra points.

To round out the meal they brought us 2 desserts for being first time guests and as an apology for the delay.

Let's just say they completely stepped in and got it completed in less than 3 hours!! Our experience has left us feeling like we can only be ""Faithful"" to these guys and no one else!! Our first contact with Christopher Moving came after reading all the grand Yelp reviews, from that, I thought what could it hurt to add another ""Great"" review? From the first phone call to the wrap-up of the move;  I would like to say that our experience was definitely worth taking the time to write an additional review.

It's a great place for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike. The service is very quick and the staff is very courteous and personable. I'm always greeted with a smile and ""thank you"".

354,626,,"This has got to be by far the nicest hotel I've stayed in during my stints in Vegas. It is kind of amazing inside.

We get there late and find that they have given up our room. Ok so we're off to a poor start, the front desk tries to ask us to pay for an upgrade to another room, but hello this is not our fault, so with that reasoning we get bumped up. 

We walk in and it is an astonishing view. Our room on the 50th floor faces the golf course and the beautiful waterfall behind it. The room is stunning with floor to ceiling windows and decorative mirrors. The shades are drawn by buttons in the middle console next to the beds. Not only are there 2 queen beds, there are two sinks and a vanity. There's a LCD in the bathroom, plasma in the main room and the alarm clock is an iHome iPod player that can charge our iPhones with. The room is amazing.

Downstairs there are several late dining facilities and stores that open till midnight and serve drinks like mimosas and sparkling wine while you peruse the products. I get giddy just thinking about how nice it was. 

The staff and promoters here were also very helpful. Being guests there we had instant access to the club, which opens up onto their outdoor waterfall. While the music was subpar which I find with many Vegas clubs the view was fabulous and the drinks were good.

I had an amazing time staying here. It doesn't matter that it's at the end of the strip, it's just one of the nicest places to stay and besides we took cabs everywhere we went so who cares about walking around?",2009-05-20 06:31:52

We were seated quickly, after a short wait during dinner rush. Our wait staff was helpful and attentive to our needs. It was my first visit, so there were explanations to get my expectations adjusted for how it works. 

The menus are posted around the room walls and are simple to see/understand. The cuisine is much like you would expect for an Italian kitchen. All entrees are served to the table with your choice of wine (red or white) kept at the table, in carafes.  

Our food came quickly, but not before a round of bread that was toasted and buttered and smothered in garlic. I can't be sure, but the bread may have been delivered straight from Heaven. A side salad or soup is offered while waiting for dinner. The salad was a garden variety with Italian dressing. It wasn't large, but it went well with the bread and wine. 

The portions were quite satisfying. I was able to eat all of my Lasagna, and I was happy to walk from the restaurant to The Strip for an after-dinner show. The lasagna was served with a meat sauce and covered with a thin layer of cheese and baked to perfection. 

I can definitely recommend this place and will definitely be returning.",2018-09-14 03:48:40

So we bought two burgers and ate at hotel. Even then the burgers were destroyed by us in seconds while fighting over who will have the last bites! It's that good! 

The buns were tasty and fluffy with sesame seeds.

The beef patty were real quality meat that was cooked perfectly to our order, medium well done, while succulent with a bit of red inside.

The matching of the sauces, herbs and condiments bring unique flavors to each burger but retains the original flavors of the star, the burger itself.

There is even one of Liberace's ""BLINGED"" out cars that is on display of the first level of the casino not far from the Chandelier Bar.  Only downfall to this casino is it smelled slightly smokey, which I was not expecting especially since it is so new and most of the newer Casino's have in place great ventilation and technology to minimize the smell of smoke.

The bar offers a nice variety of single-malt scotch, cognac, and even a few armagnacs. One of the bartenders, Dale, knows his spirits well and has a knack for remembering his customers. The drink prices are also quite reasonable. 

The bread baskets are generously full and pair well with every sauce on the menu. We're partial to the bread with kalamata olives baked in, because seriously, they're kalamata olives! No further explanation required. :)

We've enjoyed the following dishes:

- Scallop in cream sauce with crab/shrimp (Perfect dish, esp. with the bread.)
- Halibut cheeks (Rich and delicious.)
- Filet Mignon (This isn't a steakhouse, but they still do a pretty good job on this one.)
- Salmon Wellington (Try as you might, you simply cannot eat it all.)

Ultimately, we find our way back to the scallops with cream sauce. It's our favorite dish, and it never fails to amaze.

We always enjoy top-notch service, food, and spirits in this restaurant. What a blessing to live a mile from there! :)

NOISE-SENSITIVE DINERS: When making your reservation, find out if large parties are seated at the same time or in the same room as your table. Noise is a problem as this restaurant is underground and the walls reflect everything. Try to book during off-peak hours if you can. We love this place, but we love it because we eat outside of peak hours.

This place features a very nice selection of beers and offers the possibility of seating outside, on a covered patio (that hosts a bar). It's very nice but the patio is  smoking area therefore it can be quite bothering while you are eating.

The food:
- Quesadilla: very bland, over cheesy, just a very average  ""bar food"" style quesadilla.Nothing special, not good nor bad, 2 to 2.5 stars.

- edamame: drenched in an over sweet (and over salty) soy sauce. I didn't get the point of this starter. 0 star.

- hummus: dry, pita bread: 0 star. The hummus itself beside being too dry was quite tasty. portion was huge. 3 stars.

She was fun and knowledgeable and there for our every need.  All four of us were happy were our selections.  I ordered the Hash spinach mushroom scramble, which was a little dry, but when I ordered a side of the Chipotle sauce from the Andy's Man vs food dish it was perfect.  I asked for just a little bit of the sauce because it was a little dry, but they still charged extra for the sauce.  We also ordered the ""Andy's Man Vs Food"" breakfast which was delish, although crazy carb loaded with biscuits, mashed potatoes, angel hair pasta, fried chicken, bacon and more.  Our friends got the Mango Coconut pancake and also the French toast and they absolutely loved both dishes.  The coffee was hot and very good and constantly refilled as it should be at breakfast time.

I'm going to be honest.. This was probably one of the worst vermicelli dishes I've ever had (and I've had this dish at many restaurants). The chicken lacked flavor.. It didn't have that Vietnamese ""charbroiled"" taste. And more importantly, the fish sauce was bland!! It didn't taste right.. almost as if it was watered down or they didn't make it correctly. I ate 1/4th of the bowl and ended up wasting the rest of it.

My friends ordered the pho and porridge, and they also left more than half of their food because it just wasn't good. Maybe because we're spoiled with Viet food from Garden Grove? Who knows. Oh, and service here does not exist.. Typical for an Asian restaurant I guess.

It is only about a 30 min flight to and from RDU so I am already frustrated when I arrive. I'll give you that. However, when I have a layover in Charlotte, which there are almost always delays and some issue, I find myself wishing there were more opportunities for shopping, better areas for lounging and hanging out, and better food options. Where is the fresh food for goodness sake? I spent 45 minutes of my 3 hour layover walking around, looking for something that did not look scary to eat. Then, when I sit down, everything is a sticky mess. 

It is pretty easy to maneuver and it's not so large that time is a nightmare. I have never had to go through security here as I have never flown in our out initially, only had layovers so I cannot speak for that experience.

I usually am much more generous in giving him tastes from my plate, but not with this dish!  He ordered one of the many specials offered: the dry aged ribeye.  It was a tad overcooked, but still incredibly juicy with a killer rub.  

All steaks were served a la carte (minus the bulb of roasted garlic on the side of every steak--such a great idea and oh so delicious.  I had to school the table on how to remove the garlic cloves and spread them on each bite of steak, or eat them on their own if you're a garlic lover like me), so we ordered a few things for the table: the signature Strip House Potatoes (twice baked potato gratin), steamed asparagus with Bearnaise Sauce, and Mac & Cheese.

Buche taco didn't have as much meat which was kinda sad. The corn was delicious however the amount of parmesan cheese on top killed it a bit. The mole fries are AMAZING.

They start you off with their mama's house bread and red sauce (I forgot what it's called but it's featured in my picture) and honestly, you don't really need an appetizer. Although, next time I would like to try their zucchini.

1085,503,,"Extraordinary deep-tissue massage

There's no agenda in this review, because in fact I had an issue with this business for a little while, but thankfully it was resolved to my satisfaction and I've resumed using their service.  However, after seven years in Las Vegas and many massages at many places ranging from mediocre (and overpriced) to excellent, I can say without reservation that Justin at Massage 1 gives what is absolutely the best and most effective deep tissue massage in the Las Vegas Valley.

Warning: This is not a light, relaxing, resort-style massage.  If that's what you're looking for you should book with another one of their therapists.  But if you can endure the assault on your muscles for an hour, the result will be everything you can hope for.  Normally the effects of a good massage last about a day or so for me.  After my most recent appointment with Justin, I still hadn't regained all the stress in my neck and shoulders after four days.  The workout he gave my joints wasn't pretty, but I could not have asked for better results.

Massage 1 has a great system--$50 for a one-hour session, and no membership requirement (much better deal than Massage Envy or Massage Heights)--and although he's only there two days a week, if you can land an appointment with Justin and you desperately need to relieve stress, let him know you can handle it when he goes deep, and he will work wonders!",2014-06-01 22:13:09

68,63,,"OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now.
Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one. 
Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.
Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.
Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this ""ironic""; I say, ""tacky!"" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting ""Go back to Denny's"", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal.
So, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price.",2014-02-05 18:14:36
760,627,,"Ka was the best show in Las Vegas that I have ever seen and is also the best Cirque show, considering both permanent and traveling Cirque shows. Entering the venue, the theather caught my attention as it made me feel like was in the the actual fictional setting. Speakers in thr headrest of the seat really heightened thr experience. I The storyline was probably one of the easier Cirque stories to follow, which is a blessing by Cirque standards. The show even provided a brief spoken description before the show really took off. While it may still have been difficult at times to follow the story, the visual display of acrobatics and mobile stage were an amazing display of coordination and skill. I was glad to have been able to purchase tickets at a discounted price under a buy one get one for $20 promotion and had great seats. My only reservation regarding this show was that the epic final battle seen where a performer tragically fell to her death back in June has been replaced with a rather blurry 3D projection of the same scene. I understand that the safety of the performers should be a top priority but this pivotal series serves as the climax of the show and the show runners need to come up with a better alternative.

My first bar I had and still my favorite bar is the Goji Bar and Sea Salt. It is truly the perfect balance of salty and sweet. 

The shop when you first walk in is quite overwhelming at all the different kinds of varieties that they have. Every time I go it always seems like they are just adding more and more new/ amazing favor combos. The newest one I saw was candied carrot and chocolate and believe it or not it was pretty darn good. I have to say an over all crowd favorite is probably the chocolate and bacon bar.  No matter what you are into I believe you can find something interesting here. There's everything from curry, to sesame, burbon and peanut better. They also have some very select chocolate that is vegan.

The biscuits that came out before the meal looked great. I unfortunately did not try them because it didn't fit into my current diet. Everyone else's really enjoyed them. I prefer the blackened chicken, mixed grilled vegetables and sweet potato Caroline. 

The chicken was ok at best. The seasoning was pretty good but the chicken itself was super thin and not very big. It was not a ""fresh"" chicken breast by any means. It for sure was not the star of the plate the way it should be. The single chicken tender my wife got with her chicken and gravy looked fresher, juicier and bigger. 

The mixed vegetables were good. A little too much butter or oil for me but was good. They didn't over cook them to mush like most places. 

The sweet potato Caroline was good. The candied nut topping was tasty but again prob to sweet for what the should have been eating. Reminded me of a dessert type item. Overall very tasty though. 

We skipped dessert so I can not comment on that.

The burger was supposed to be medium and it was raw. The menu didn't say anything about the toppings so I had no clue there was raw onion on it. Ewwww! Talk about a rude awakening when taking the first bite.

Now let's talk sweet potato fries from hell. They have to be from hell cause they weren't cooked - they were cremated and had a horrible ash aftertaste. Ugh! Can these cooks not see that burnt black is not a desired color for fries!",2014-10-08 01:11:06

First, my server, Lindsay, was terrific. Bright, informative, enjoyable, with excellent wine and food recommendations, she was outstanding. 

I ordered a lot, as the appetizers and sides are on the smaller side and I wanted to try a few things. I started with the Naan and dips. The naan was good, not the best I've had but very good and it didn't much matter because the trio of dips/spreads were SO good. Beet greens pesto was the best (one of the best tastes of the evening) but the yogurt dip and the roasted tomato pesto were also top notch. Yum.

The Grilled Cauliflower appetizer was good. I think I was expecting a little more char. But it had a lot of flavor. It came room temp, which surprised me as well.

Then I had a slow roasted porchetta, very very good, with wonderful green beans on the side. I also tried their potato gratin, which I loved. It was not a traditional american *au gratin* with a ton of cheese, but more roughly smashed potatoes in a gratin dish with a lot of mustard seeds. The mustard made me very happy. 

They also do a 'snack cart' which comes by your table early on. This is a great idea, very well done. I had the steak tartare, which rivaled the best steak tartare I've ever had. Easily the best dish of the night. I could face plant in that stuff.

Very neat ambiance.  Reminds me of the Venetian in Vegas.  Upscale and wide open so the noise level is slightly above average.

The food....  Yummy as can be!  I'm one who counts carbs so why am I going to an Italian restaurant?  The salmon is to die for.  The steaks are to die for.  Even the salads are yummy.

I went in and was met by a woman. Who was SO diligent in helping me find the perfect band for my fiancé. I'm not kidding you, she had stacks of rings piled on her fingers because I'm so fickle. Finally I picked one out and she and I ogled over it until she set me up with one of the diamond specialist. This guy could sell fire to the devil. He was smooth, But he made me feel valuable. I sat down with him and told him my budget. He raised his eyebrows and nodded (I figured that's a good sign) he took an hour and compared diamonds with me. So all in all: I picked out the band, I picked out the diamond and I designed the entire ring, which he explained, will mean even more to the girl I give it to. And it did. She loved it and thank God said ""yes"" well, she said "" uh....  Seriously.?... Is this a joke?...."" But eventually came around. I've proclaimed to the world about The Shane Co.  but I thought I would do them the service of doing a review.

Based on recommendations found here, I ordered the pollo fundido and was not disappointed. It was very good.

After all of this, are you wondering why the two-star review? It comes down to one thing. SALSA. It's not hard to make a simple, pleasant salsa. One can be a self-declared talent-less cook and still manage to produce a palatable salsa. With my salsa-addicted boyfriend and our history of always polishing off the salsa and chips provided with the meal, we left our table with three salsas remaining.

One was a tomatillo salsa.  It was probably the best of the three,...after adding a substantial amount of salt to it. (We were told the secret ingredient of this was iceberg lettuce.)

The second salsa had a weird underlying flavor to it, almost like paprika. It was just funky. (The secret ingredient of this concoction was dried pepper, which probably explains the smokey flavor it had.)

The third salsa was more like a mushy tomato sauce. It would be best paired with mozzarella sticks.  (This salsa, the house salsa, was made with canned tomatoes and garlic. That's it. Seriously?) 

For a Mexican restaurant that puts out good food, salsa of this poor quality is inexcusable and a little shocking.",2014-07-27 21:46:33

Both times I have been we had 5 girls in a room and it did not feel cramped.  The extra bathroom and sitting area is great for a large group.  

The bathrooms are very large and updated.  The beds are incredibly comfortable (although any bed after a night at the Vegas clubs is probably comfortable).  It is on the strip, but at one end.  There aren't too many places within walking distance.

They do have a liquor store across the street that you can walk to.  I also highly recommend Evening Call, the little bar right as you enter the casino floor.  They have great alcoholic slushy drinks that are great while sitting by the pool.  Speaking of the pools that is another aspect of THEhotel that I love.  They have a large wave pool that is always filled with kids and families.  It is great if you like wave pools.  They also have a lazy river that is fun for all ages.  There are a few smaller pools that cater more to the adult crowd.  Then there is also the ""toptional"" pool that I don't remember the name of.  They have great music and it is definitely adults only.  There is a cover to get into this pool which for guys is quite steep but it is a lot of fun.  

Overall I would definitely recommend THEhotel especially if you are with a big group.  There are lots of great restaurants nearby.  They have a few fun bars (the view from the Foundation Room is amazing).  And the rooms themselves are great.",2011-08-25 00:43:30

The Wicked Spoon really is pretty wicked... it's that good. I admit their ambiance, decor, and presentation of food really add to the appeal and satisfies my anger just right. 

Food was great. Presentation added a bunch to the taste I am sure! Who dosn't want to eat Mac n Cheese in mini pots? Everything from soups to pizzas, breakfast foods like bagels , french toast, eggs...to cheeses, seafood, Chinese, sausages, Korean BBQ ribs, pizza, and fruit and dessert. 

Service was superb. Lady (forgot her name...yikes) remembered my name and repeated it several times throughout the dining experience...""How is everything Jen?"", "" Jen what else can I get you? "" ""Thanks so much Jen, have a great day"" ..holy cow..how did she remember my name with all the other tables she had? I don't care how...not many people do that..and she impressed me. Needless to say I tipped her well as she was on top of everything. 

Food was just that..brunch. Breakfast+ lunch. Oh and a whole load of desserts.

Best toast I ever had in my life. One bite turned into 5 different flavors right after another. Amaze-balls. 

Tip: Currently $34 for brunch and add 10 dollars for bottomless mimosas/champagne/bloody Marys. If you want to go the cheap but want to be buzzed route...just half the amount of bottomless drinks per party (i.e get 1 bottomless to share for 2..seriously they don't care and never notice...they just want tips) BUT NO, seriously don't do that because that is JUST WRONG ...right???!",2013-11-26 05:24:52

730,79,,"I'm about to change your life in three words: 
Chile Relleno Burrito. 

First and foremost, everything at Chino's is exceptional. It's not fine dinning, but it hits the spot whenever I'm craving something out of the ordinary and affordable. Do you have the munchies right now? If so, stop reading and head to Chino's. I've been eating here since I was a teenager, or rather, I should say feasting here. 


The ordering style at Chino's leaves you with the ability to create your own meal. Typically, I choose the two item combo which comes with rice and beans. Now, you cannot go wrong with either the black beans or pinto beans. I have a hard time making that life choice between the two. Perhaps I'm biased, but I prefer their plain fried rice overall. Once those sides are taken care of, I make the first entree item choice of a Chinese food inspired meat. Honestly, they're all good choices but I find myself getting the teriyaki chicken most often. 

However, my next choice is where the real magic happens. Chile Relleno Burrito. Yes. Yes, you read that right. Now, Chino's Chile Relleno is amazing in and of itself. This is due to the delicious crunchy goodness that they surround their chile it in; I think it's crackers! Ritz, maybe? Delicious, most definitely! Now, imagine that wrapped in more cheesy goodness and a tortilla. Heaven. You've got heaven.",2015-01-18 19:09:10

I told Tony I wanted several different options for the windows and that I wasn't sure if I wanted to change out the sliders for french doors. He happily gave me quotes for both Simonton windows and Milgard windows as well as Milgard sliders and Simonton french doors.

The install was set across two days but I was called and told there was a scheduling conflict and was rescheduled for a single day install with a bigger crew. They answered al my questions and were courteous as I was working from home. They cleaned up afterward and walked me through the install. They also added some caulking that I asked for. 

The reason they lose a star is because the window frames were left fairly dirty with sticky residue and black scuff marks on the frames. They cleaned the glass, but not the frames so I had to do so. They also put tan trim on the exterior of the home when the contract said white and the window frames were white. When I asked them why they did that they said they thought it matched the color of the home better. It's not a huge deal but I asked for white windows with white trim and the contract was for white windows and white trim. I can paint the trim so it's not a big deal, but it warranted a loss of a star. 

Overall I am very impressed and would highly recommend them.",2015-12-19 00:04:01
1802,608,,"I went 4 consecutive weekdays to find a 2 hour wait. ""Woah. This place must be awesome!""

When we finally got in, we were not very impressed. I got a lobster sauce dish that was largely flavorless. About a year later, I decided to give it another try, thinking that maybe I had ordered the wrong thing. This time I stuck to more familiar territories and got some sort of bulgogi inspired dish that was being called out on the menu (I wish I remembered the name) and my husband got the Singapore Street Noodles. My dish tasted odd to me, with a very strong, bitter even, taste of orange zest. His was a bit better, but neither of us enjoyed it. I didn't even enjoy their crab rangoon, which I usually love. 

I have had authentic Chinese and Americanized Chinese food, all types of Asian cuisine...and somehow the fusion P.F.Changs delivers tastes odd to me, bland when it shouldn't be and too intense in others.

The staff and ambience are very nice, but ultimately the food is not simply not for me. Since then, I have been (affectionately) calling it P.F. Chunks.",2016-07-31 19:35:57
2240,1209,,"I usually go to Midway Chevy for all devices on my car, however I decided to give Autonation Chevrolet Arrowhead a chance since it is closer to me. Today is the first and last time. I arrived and asked the person who greeted me if they accept competitors coupons and was told yes they did.  After waiting about 10 minutes for a service rep I was told by this service rep that they don't accept competitors coupons and that it would be $12 more than what the competitor would have charged. Midway chevy does accept competitors coupons without any question. It isn't like I was using the $12 coupon from Big O tires. It was from a local Chevrolet dealership.  She asked who told me and then asked the kid who did and told him he was wrong and shouldn't be saying it. If I had known I would have either gone someplace else or gone back to midway Chevy. Be warned.. They will tell you yes until it comes time for them to take the car,  then tell you know and charge you more. I will not come back to this dealership in the future,  for service and definitely will not buy from them if this is the way they treat their customers.",2016-01-29 23:17:36

592,299,,"Wow can I be more impressed? First of all, if you are a ramen enthusiast, then you have heard about shin sen gumi ramen from LA j-town. Shin-sen-gumi is the crown of ramen on the west coast, so to be able to go up against shin sen gumi is something to be proud off. The tonkatsu ramen soup here taste almost identical to shin sen gumi and I was blown away. Most establishments have really salty or weird flavor soup base like adding butter and garlic for a more western tongue (names I would not mention). The noodle here is the thin style but was a bit more soft compared to shin.  The owner said he could make it more chewy if I wanted to since everything is made by him including the noodles. He also said that his ramen has no added msg or preservative which is surprising to hear. I mean what? Asian food with no msg = mind blown.

Now for the con, the chashu and egg is very average. Here I feel the meat isn't marinated as much and not as sweet. The egg is bland as well like a hard boiled egg, maybe that was the intention to accentuate the flavor of the soup. The place needs more tables also. 

So why did I give 5 stars, based on the soup, noodle, and no msg, this place is on par with shin sen gumi. I support local family business and no longer need to go to la for good ramen. This will be my primary spot from now on.",2017-10-24 20:47:11

The staff was quick to greet us and we even had the pleasure of meeting the owner who is just as passionate about the business as the rest of the staff. Yes, the menu is filled with amazing hot dog concoctions as the name suggests, (you gotta try the Dan's Famous Dog and the Hula Dog, but take the owners word for it, top that baby with jalapenos, you wont be disappointed!). If dogs aren't your thing tho, that's ok, they have burgers, sandwiches and AUNT KAY'S BEANS!

312,413,,"This buffet is located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. The overall ambience is nice and feels upscale. Like most buffets there are a variety of sections such as salad, meat, seafood, and dessert.

I think they prioritized quantity over quality, as most of the food was nothing special. However, the highlights for me were the prime rib and dessert bar. You can ask to get the prime rib grilled, and there is rosemary sauce too.

It cost $52 per person, before tip, at dinner on a weekend. That's equivalent to 6.5 Chipotle burritos. I would take the 6 burritos over a single buffet entry any day.

Not only that but the checkout is ridiculous as well. They have maybe 5 lanes open with at least 6 or more carts in each. While shopping we heard over the PA system the call for more cashiers, so I'm thinking oh good while I continue to shop the checkout lanes should die down. Um no 10 min later there are still only 5 lanes open and no relief in sight. Seriously Walmart? I prefer Target but the closest one is still in the process of constructing their fresh grocery section.

The patty is a generous portion, so it's definitely possible to split a burger and order some gravy fries to share. Overall, we thought that the food was a bit too salty.

OK, rewind:
It was 11:40am when we got in line on Sunday.

About an infinity and a half later (more like 45 minutes), we were seated.

Two seconds later, I was in line, shoveling food onto my plate, including:
-Crispy, crunchy bacon
-Waffles with bacon cooked-in
-Pork sausages
-Thick-cut peppered bacon
-Cha siu bao (Chinese pork buns)
-Salami and prosciutto

They also had shrimp cocktail, bagels and lox, varying dim sum and sushi, and different stations for made-to-order:
-Congee
-Pancakes
-Omelets

A dedicated Italian section with pizza, pastas, meat and cheese plates, and entire room reserved for sweets with croissants, cookies, cupcakes, mini cakes, and tartlets, fresh fruit, yogurt, parfaits, puddings, and ice cream.

Atmosphere: Perfect. Admittedly, we're both very into steampunk, industrial sort of looks, and this place pulled it off beautifully, from the decorations to the uniforms.

Drinks: I got ""Some Like it Hot,"" which is comprised of Ford's gin, Solerno blood orange liqueur, honey syrup, lemon, habanero shrub bitters, sierra nevada pale ale, smoked paprika-pink Himalayan salt. It was a unique taste, and I sucked it down. (I love me some foods/drinks with a kick.

She got ""How Many Licks"" on the server's recommendation, comprised of raisin-infused Hennessy Black cognac, house-made plum-vanilla bean shrub, disaronno amaretto, lemon, sauternes wine, fever-free soda water, grated nutmeg, cognac-soaked raisins. She really enjoyed it ... and again, a very unique flavor (tasted like ... as you'd assume ... raisins).

Food: We got (forgive me, I forget some of the names) shrimp corndogs, chicken pot pie nuggets, and inside-out French onion grilled cheese sandwiches. All three were awesome. We both adored the sandwiches, and our opinions were flipped on the corndogs vs nuggets. (I loved the corndogs, she loved the nuggets, and we were both just OK with the other.)

Downsides: A little expensive, and the serving staff was a bit *too* attentive (they were almost vultures, secretly and awkwardly spying on us to make sure we didn't need anything, and a different person would come by our table every few minutes to ask how everything was). Those are small complaints, to be sure, and regarding the staff ... it's been open for FIVE DAYS as of this post, and they're still getting their sea legs; given that, I think they did an excellent job. Better to err on the side of TOO much service rather than lazy service.",2013-07-13 15:32:49
222,162,,"With so many wonderful restaurants there is no reason to come here.
I will never come back.
Service was bad, food was bad (except the soup), atmosphere was nice although it opens into the slot machines at Luxor.

If you sit at the bar, there is a huge pillar with a flat screen, which is great for watching sports, but hides you away from the bartender if you sit to the righthand side.  
I had to get up and get his attention because he couldn't see me.
The girl that sat down next to me actually moved to one of the tables in the lounge because the service was so bad (she did get great service from the cocktail waitress though).

The Wild Mushroom soup was amazing, that is why the restaurant gets a star.  Have the soup, then go somewhere else for the main course.

The steak I ordered was tasteless, I had to order a side of bearnaise sauce to get it down and I love steak; I would eat steak everyday if I could, but not from here even if it was free (which it definately wasn't).  And the bearnaise was tasteless as well.  If I hadn't enjoyed the soup so much I would have thought something was wrong with my sense of taste.

The wine also tasted like it had been opened the day before or maybe even the day before that.  I'm not a wine snob, but it was like vinegar.  The bartender didn't even bother pouring a little for himself to see if it had gone bad.
This was the first time in my life I had to refuse a glass of wine.",2010-07-07 20:11:53

681,746,,"Nice view of the Strip, beautiful design and very good service. The food was good but not exceptional. We had the orzo meatballs,  a couple of pasta dishes and the veal chop. The veal chop was very good. But when we asked for a side of pasta, they couldn't do it. That left a bad test in my mouth. For the prices they charge, this was not acceptable.
In conclusion, there are better restaurants in Vegas for the same price.",2018-07-07 21:40:14
1976,765,,"The place lives up!! From the food to the valets. The food is great and arrived at lightening speed!  even on a packed night! (That alone got it 3 stars, take a lesson rivals) Bar is stacked with a good selection of liquor  and awesome craft cocktails.  Value is definitely there! For the price and speed I would go again in a second! Give this place a go and you wont regret it. Well done suma maya!! this place is on fire",2015-01-29 04:37:40

1494,21,,"Waited in line for what seemed like forever. We had already pre booked online but the price shot up almost double after we got there due to extra fees and taxes and stuff. We wanted a white suv and were told we got a white Toyota SUV and to go downstairs to slot B3 and it would be ready and waiting for us. We went downstairs and couldn't find it so we had to get help only to find out B3 didn't exist and apparently, neither did our car! So, we had to wait once again for them to find us a car which ended up being a black SUV with black leather interior which is the last thing we wanted during 115 degree weather and of course, no car seat which we paid for so we had to wait for that as well. The car was nice but the back seat areas weren't cleaned out at all so we ended up having to vacuum out other people's sunflower seeds and goldfish. Overall, I'd say budget isn't a bad place to rent a car, we had a good experience in Hawaii but at sky harbor airport DON'T DO IT!!!!!! You'll regret it!!!",2017-06-26 20:50:30

568,288,,"I used to love this place. It all went down the past few weeks. The food quality was lacking compared to their norm. Usually I could have shrugged this off but this last time was most disappointing. My wife was just cut from a long double. When we walked in I noticed three very young snickering girls at the bar. The bartender approached us and after ordering our drinks he said he couldn't serve my wife because the manager, who was one of the snickering girls, believed she was intoxicated, which was quite the opposite. The girls sitting around the bar continued to laugh. Obviously we were way more aware than they realized. Normally they have decent bar food and good drink specials but if this how they treat customers they don't deserve business. The biggest complaint is their beer lines taste dirty. The biggest plus used to be fried pickles but now I just enjoy them at The Turf instead. Usually I'm not so easily offended but this was bit ridiculous. I will definitely update my review if this changes.",2013-10-24 07:16:32
